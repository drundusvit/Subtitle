00:00:39:79&00:00:41:66#Really? Is she hot?
00:00:41:75&00:00:44:08#How old are you now,
Scott? Like, 28?
00:00:44:16&00:00:46:00#I'm not playing your little games, kids.
00:00:46:08&00:00:48:46#So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.
00:00:48:54&00:00:51:21#I'm 22. Twenty-two.
00:00:52:84&00:00:55:68#And you're dating a high-school girl.
Not bad, not bad.
00:00:55:88&00:00:57:72#Thank you,
thank you.
00:00:57:80&00:01:02:18#So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?
00:01:02:81&00:01:04:60#We have done many things.
00:01:04:69&00:01:06:14#We ride the bus together.
00:01:06:44&00:01:10:57#And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went
00:01:10:65&00:01:13:78#and about her friends
and, you know, drama.
00:01:14:19&00:01:15:57#Have you even kissed her?
00:01:15:65&00:01:18:03#We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.
00:01:18:12&00:01:19:45#Well, aren't you pleased as punch.
00:01:19:53&00:01:20:70#I don't know what you're talking about.
00:01:20:78&00:01:21:83#So, what's her name?
00:01:22:58&00:01:24:54#Knives Chau.
00:01:25:33&00:01:26:50#She's Chinese.
00:01:28:13&00:01:29:33#Wicked.
00:01:29:42&00:01:30:59#So, when do we get to meet her?
00:01:30:67&00:01:32:25#Oh, please,
let it be soon.
00:01:32:55&00:01:34:17#That's for me.
00:01:36:93&00:01:38:80#Hi.
You promise to be good?
00:01:38:89&00:01:40:09#Of course I'll be good.
00:01:40:22&00:01:41:43#Seriously, please be good.
00:01:41:68&00:01:43:10#Am I normally not?
00:01:43:68&00:01:46:81#Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills.
He's the talent.
00:01:47:56&00:01:49:19#Hey.
00:01:49:98&00:01:50:98#Is she gonna geek out on us?
00:01:51:06&00:01:52:19#She'll just sit in the corner, man.
00:01:52:48&00:01:54:32#I mean, I want her
to geek out on us.
00:01:54:40&00:01:57:61#She'll geek. She geeks.
She has the capacity to geek.
00:01:57:70&00:01:58:86#Okay.
00:02:00:20&00:02:01:28#You're good.
00:02:05:70&00:02:06:75#Wow.
00:02:06:83&00:02:07:87#Here, let me get your coat.
00:02:07:96&00:02:09:17#Hi.
00:02:09:25&00:02:10:71#Knives, that's Kim.
00:02:11:79&00:02:13:00#Sorry, what was your name?
00:02:13:34&00:02:14:30#Kim.
00:02:14:38&00:02:16:01#And you play the drums?
00:02:16:72&00:02:17:76#Yes.
00:02:17:84&00:02:19:72#That is so awesome.
00:02:19:93&00:02:21:55#Knives, that's Young Neil.
00:02:21:93&00:02:24:60#Hi.
00:02:24:72&00:02:26:47#What do you play?
00:02:27:52&00:02:33:23#Wow, Zelda, Tetris.
00:02:34:19&00:02:35:86#That's kind of a big question.
00:02:36:78&00:02:39:11#Okay, let's start with
Launchpad McQuack.
00:02:39:20&00:02:40:70#That's not the actual title of the...
00:02:40:78&00:02:42:53#We are Sex Bob-Omb!
00:02:42:62&00:02:44:03#One, two, three, four!
00:02:50:54&00:02:52:38#Yeah, yeah
00:02:53:21&00:02:54:75#Yeah, yeah
00:02:55:50&00:02:57:76#Laminate the stasis
00:02:57:84&00:03:00:63#Mama, mama serpentine
00:03:00:72&00:03:03:30#I got a breathalyzer
00:03:03:39&00:03:05:85#And my body's clean
00:03:12:90&00:03:15:02#Yeah! Yeah!
00:03:40:63&00:03:42:17#Thank you!
00:04:03:95&00:04:05:49#Get ready
00:04:07:53&00:04:08:62#Yeah
00:04:24:38&00:04:28:51#Yeah, yeah
00:04:33:64&00:04:36:31#Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
00:04:36:40&00:04:37:77#Yeah!
00:04:42:65&00:04:45:91#You guys are so
00:04:47:82&00:04:50:12#amazing.
00:04:50:20&00:04:51:62#She seems nice.
Yeah.
00:04:51:70&00:04:52:83#Yeah, she seems awesome.
00:04:53:08&00:04:54:08#Yeah.
00:04:54:16&00:04:56:62#Scott, if your life had a face,
I would punch it.
00:04:56:71&00:04:58:75#Yeah. Wait, what?
00:04:58:84&00:05:01:80#I mean, are you really happy
or are you really evil?
00:05:02:46&00:05:04:22#Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?
00:05:04:30&00:05:05:42#I'm offended, Kim.
00:05:05:51&00:05:06:72#Wounded, even?
00:05:07:26&00:05:08:30#Hurt, Kim.
00:05:08:39&00:05:09:85#You? Hurt?
00:05:11:10&00:05:13:35#Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome."
00:05:13:73&00:05:15:10#Yeah, she seems awesome.
00:05:15:19&00:05:16:48#Yeah.
00:05:21:82&00:05:23:61#Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,
00:05:23:69&00:05:25:24#yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old.
00:05:25:65&00:05:26:65#Oh, is he cute?
00:05:28:03&00:05:30:28#Does this mean we have to
stop sleeping together?
00:05:30:37&00:05:32:66#You see another bed in here?
00:05:32:87&00:05:35:79#Yeah. You're totally
my bitch forever.
00:05:44:63&00:05:47:93#So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.
00:05:48:01&00:05:49:72#Hey, you know me.
00:05:49:80&00:05:51:01#I mean,
don't tell my sister.
00:05:52:85&00:05:53:97#You know me.
00:05:54:10&00:05:55:27#Who are you texting?
00:05:57:94&00:05:59:81#Seventeen years old?
Scandal!
00:05:59:90&00:06:01:61#That's not true.
Who told you?
00:06:01:69&00:06:02:69#Wallace. Duh.
00:06:02:77&00:06:04:07#That gossipy bitch.
00:06:04:44&00:06:05:48#You know me.
00:06:05:57&00:06:06:57#Wallace!
00:06:07:11&00:06:08:70#Who is this mystery child you date?
00:06:08:78&00:06:10:99#Her name's Knives Chau.
She's Chinese.
00:06:11:70&00:06:16:25#A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl?
You're ridiculous.
00:06:16:33&00:06:17:87#It's a Catholic school, too.
00:06:17:96&00:06:19:25#With the uniform and everything?
00:06:19:42&00:06:20:71#Yeah.
The whole deal.
00:06:21:84&00:06:23:34#Oh, my God.
You guys haven't...
00:06:23:42&00:06:26:17#No, no, no, no.
We haven't even held hands yet.
00:06:26:26&00:06:28:26#I think she hugged me once.
00:06:28:34&00:06:30:38#Scott, why are you doing this?
00:06:30:47&00:06:34:14#I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.
00:06:34:22&00:06:35:64#It's been over a year
since you got dumped
00:06:35:72&00:06:37:98#by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named.
So...
00:06:39:52&00:06:40:73#Are you legitimately moving on
00:06:40:81&00:06:42:52#or is this just you being insane?
00:06:42:94&00:06:44:57#Can I get back to you on that?
00:06:47:61&00:06:49:57#I do not wanna be here at all.
00:06:50:11&00:06:51:66#This school has boys, too.
00:06:52:16&00:06:56:24#I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.
00:06:56:33&00:06:57:54#Well, she's only allowed out
00:06:57:62&00:06:59:66#when the sun is up,
so I wouldn't call it dating.
00:07:00:21&00:07:02:04#It's more like... Playtime?
00:07:02:13&00:07:03:79#That doesn't sound so good, either. No.
00:07:03:88&00:07:05:04#Scott!
00:07:05:46&00:07:06:46#Hey, Knives.
00:07:06:55&00:07:08:63#This is my cool,
gay roommate, Wallace Wells.
00:07:08:72&00:07:09:88#Hi.
He's gay.
00:07:10:18&00:07:12:64#Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?
00:07:12:72&00:07:14:22#Yes, does he wear glasses?
00:07:14:30&00:07:16:56#Wallace, you go now.
Begone.
00:07:19:06&00:07:21:64#You're too good
for him. Run.
00:07:24:40&00:07:26:02#Get ready!
00:07:26:69&00:07:27:73#Here we go!
00:07:32:66&00:07:35:28#Did you know that the original
name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?
00:07:35:78&00:07:37:58#You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,
00:07:37:66&00:07:40:08#but it actually comes from the
Japanese phrase "paku-paku,"
00:07:40:16&00:07:41:91#which means,
"to flap one's mouth open and closed."
00:07:43:67&00:07:44:75#They changed it because
they thought that
00:07:44:84&00:07:46:59#"Puck-Man" would be
too easy to vandalize.
00:07:46:67&00:07:47:75#You know,
people could just scratch off
00:07:47:84&00:07:49:51#the "P" and turn it
into an "F" or whatever.
00:07:50:09&00:07:53:18#Oh, my God!
Like, wow!
00:07:53:30&00:07:54:55#Combo!
00:07:58:18&00:07:59:18#Yeah. Wow.
00:07:59:27&00:08:00:31#Continue?
00:08:00:39&00:08:05:77#Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
00:08:05:86&00:08:07:15#three...
Oh, I got it.
00:08:07:23&00:08:08:48#...two, one.
00:08:12:32&00:08:14:32#I don't listen to that much music.
00:08:14:41&00:08:17:53#I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...
00:08:18:29&00:08:20:20#You guys rock.
00:08:20:29&00:08:21:79#Well, I knew I personally rocked,
00:08:21:87&00:08:24:46#but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.
00:08:24:54&00:08:25:71#So, thank you, Knives.
00:08:25:79&00:08:28:04#I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.
00:08:28:50&00:08:29:88#Well, we're already pretty big,
00:08:29:96&00:08:31:46#but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool
00:08:31:55&00:08:33:80#if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.
00:08:33:88&00:08:35:59#Cool.
Yeah, yeah.
00:08:35:68&00:08:38:97#Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?
00:08:39:06&00:08:42:47#Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?
00:08:42:56&00:08:44:06#Thank you, Julie.
00:08:44:19&00:08:45:64#Are you coming to my party Friday,
00:08:45:73&00:08:48:61#or will you be busy babysitting?
00:08:49:19&00:08:51:36#Thank you, Julie.
00:08:51:44&00:08:53:03#You don't want to listen to her.
00:08:53:53&00:08:55:86#And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.
00:08:55:95&00:08:57:66#Oh, I heart them so much.
00:08:57:74&00:09:01:24#Yeah, I hearted them, too,
until they signed to a major label,
00:09:01:33&00:09:05:04#and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.
00:09:05:12&00:09:06:67#But that's just me.
00:09:06:75&00:09:10:17#Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?
00:09:10:25&00:09:11:80#Sorry, you were saying about me?
00:09:11:88&00:09:14:80#I mean, I've never gone out
with anyone so talented.
00:09:15:05&00:09:16:18#Go out with a lot of guys?
00:09:16:26&00:09:17:26#No.
00:09:17:47&00:09:19:68#Yeah, so, whatever, man.
00:09:19:76&00:09:21:60#I've never even kissed a guy.
00:09:25:44&00:09:26:64#Hey,
00:09:27:44&00:09:28:69#me, neither.
00:09:40:49&00:09:42:33#Here you go.
00:09:42:41&00:09:43:74#So, this is your secret lair?
00:09:43:83&00:09:45:58#Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?
00:09:46:08&00:09:48:62#My secret lair is one of those
00:09:48:71&00:09:50:46#"No girls allowed"-type deals.
00:09:50:71&00:09:51:79#Okay.
00:09:51:88&00:09:53:38#But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?
00:09:53:46&00:09:55:05#Sure!
Come on.
00:09:57:30&00:09:58:30#There you go.
00:09:59:80&00:10:01:14#Wow.
00:10:01:47&00:10:02:47#Yeah.
00:10:03:52&00:10:04:81#Wow.
00:10:12:36&00:10:13:82#Oh, God.
00:10:16:49&00:10:18:11#So alone.
00:10:19:78&00:10:21:16#You're not alone.
00:10:21:37&00:10:22:62#What?
00:10:22:70&00:10:25:45#You're just having some idiotic dream.
00:10:26:45&00:10:28:08#Does that mean we can make out?
00:10:28:16&00:10:29:96#Oh, God!
00:10:30:04&00:10:31:08#What is it, Scott?
00:10:31:17&00:10:32:29#I had this totally weird dream.
00:10:32:38&00:10:33:59#Oh, God.
00:10:33:67&00:10:34:92#What is it,
Other Scott?
00:10:35:05&00:10:38:30#Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.
00:10:38:38&00:10:39:68#But there was this girl.
00:10:39:80&00:10:41:05#Girl?
00:10:41:14&00:10:42:59#Was this an Envy-related dream?
00:10:42:68&00:10:44:26#We don't use the E-word in this house.
00:10:44:35&00:10:47:43#No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.
00:10:47:52&00:10:49:48#Yay for that.
00:10:49:56&00:10:50:77#Speaking of new,
00:10:50:85&00:10:52:73#weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend
00:10:52:81&00:10:54:40#to the library a half-hour ago?
00:10:54:73&00:10:56:98#What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.
00:11:01:53&00:11:02:82#It's weird.
00:11:02:91&00:11:04:45#What's weird?
00:11:04:53&00:11:07:29#Libraries remind me of grade school.
00:11:07:37&00:11:09:79#That must seem like a
really long time ago.
00:11:09:87&00:11:12:54#Yeah, let's talk about something else.
00:11:31:81&00:11:33:10#Do you know that girl?
00:11:34:69&00:11:36:11#Scott!
What?
00:11:36:57&00:11:38:98#You only played one note
for that entire song.
00:11:39:99&00:11:41:07#My hand slipped.
00:11:41:15&00:11:42:91#Is your girlfriend distracting you?
00:11:43:03&00:11:44:74#My girlfriend?
00:11:44:82&00:11:46:16#I'll be quieter.
00:11:47:29&00:11:48:54#Let's do that one again.
00:11:48:66&00:11:49:87#Sorry, what are we doing?
00:11:49:95&00:11:51:29#I told you, like,
50 times!
00:11:51:37&00:11:53:17#We're going to this party, retard.
00:11:53:25&00:11:55:42#Party?
At Julie's.
00:11:55:50&00:11:56:50#I thought you guys split up.
00:11:56:59&00:11:59:05#We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...
00:11:59:13&00:12:01:01#Oh, man,
this is gonna suck. Suck!
00:12:01:09&00:12:03:26#At least it'll give us
something to complain about.
00:12:03:34&00:12:04:43#Oh, man!
00:12:04:51&00:12:05:64#This sucks!
00:12:05:72&00:12:06:80#Sucks!
00:12:06:89&00:12:09:93#I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.
00:12:11:02&00:12:12:48#I have to pee.
00:12:12:56&00:12:14:14#You know, so I told him you've
got a really good sound,
00:12:14:23&00:12:15:69#and I think that you
should market your sound
00:12:15:77&00:12:18:23#to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!
00:12:18:32&00:12:19:32#Hey, Comeau.
00:12:19:40&00:12:21:19#How about this party?
You getting your drink on here?
00:12:21:28&00:12:23:11#No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.
00:12:23:20&00:12:24:49#What do you mean,
you don't drink?
00:12:24:57&00:12:26:91#I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...
00:12:26:99&00:12:28:37#Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?
00:12:28:45&00:12:30:49#Yeah, pretty much,
I do.
00:12:30:79&00:12:32:25#You know this one girl
with hair like this?
00:12:32:33&00:12:33:75#Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.
00:12:33:83&00:12:35:83#Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.
00:12:35:92&00:12:37:21#What?
Oh, Scott.
00:12:37:29&00:12:39:38#You have the hots for her or something?
I gotta tell you though,
00:12:39:46&00:12:40:92#I hear that she's a little hardcore.
00:13:22:67&00:13:23:96#Hey, what's up?
00:13:24:38&00:13:25:38#Nothing.
00:13:25:47&00:13:26:76#Hey, you know Pac-Man?
00:13:26:84&00:13:28:34#I know of him.
00:13:28:64&00:13:32:01#Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.
00:13:32:93&00:13:34:60#They changed it because...
00:13:34:68&00:13:36:77#Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.
00:13:36:85&00:13:39:27#"Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth,"
00:13:39:36&00:13:41:94#and that they were afraid
people would change...
00:13:42:03&00:13:45:82#Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...
00:13:48:03&00:13:49:70#Yeah, that's amazing.
00:13:50:24&00:13:51:24#Um...
00:13:52:45&00:13:53:62#Am I dreaming?
00:13:56:21&00:13:57:66#I'll leave you alone forever now.
00:13:57:75&00:13:58:83#Thanks.
00:14:06:34&00:14:07:34#Dude!
What?
00:14:07:43&00:14:08:68#She's totally real!
Who?
00:14:08:76&00:14:10:30#Ramona Flowers.
What?
00:14:10:39&00:14:12:47#Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?
00:14:12:56&00:14:14:18#All I know is that she is American.
00:14:14:27&00:14:15:31#American.
00:14:15:39&00:14:16:81#Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?
00:14:16:89&00:14:17:98#They know a lot more.
00:14:18:06&00:14:20:15#Lady-dudes.
What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
00:14:20:23&00:14:21:52#I heard she has a boyfriend.
00:14:21:61&00:14:23:02#Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.
00:14:23:23&00:14:24:82#Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?
00:14:24:90&00:14:27:32#I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.
00:14:27:40&00:14:29:91#She's on another level.
00:14:29:99&00:14:31:87#She has men dying at her feet.
00:14:31:95&00:14:34:58#She's got some battle scars, dude.
00:14:34:70&00:14:36:16#What about Ramona Flowers?
00:14:36:25&00:14:37:25#You know her?
Tell me now.
00:14:37:33&00:14:38:33#She just moved here.
00:14:38:41&00:14:39:96#Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.
00:14:40:04&00:14:41:00#Does she really?
00:14:41:08&00:14:42:75#Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?
00:14:42:84&00:14:43:88#Did she really?
00:14:43:96&00:14:45:21#They had a huge fight,
or whatever.
00:14:45:30&00:14:46:30#Did they really?
00:14:46:38&00:14:48:76#Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.
00:14:48:84&00:14:50:80#Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.
00:14:50:89&00:14:53:05#Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,
00:14:53:14&00:14:55:43#even if you haven't had a real
girlfriend in over a year.
00:14:56:60&00:14:59:94#Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.
00:15:00:02&00:15:01:60#He's totally dating a high-schooler.
00:15:01:69&00:15:03:65#Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.
00:15:03:73&00:15:04:86#She's got a point.
00:15:04:94&00:15:06:02#I thought you guys broke up.
00:15:06:11&00:15:08:86#I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.
00:15:08:95&00:15:11:53#We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.
00:15:11:61&00:15:13:03#That's completely untrue.
00:15:13:12&00:15:14:87#That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.
00:15:14:99&00:15:16:91#That time with Hollie?
That wasn't what it looked like.
00:15:17:00&00:15:18:04#That time you dumped Kim for...
00:15:18:12&00:15:19:91#Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?
00:15:21:67&00:15:24:71#Whatever! Ramona's out of your league.
Let's just leave it at that.
00:15:24:79&00:15:27:09#Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.
00:15:27:17&00:15:29:34#She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.
00:15:29:42&00:15:30:88#Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.
00:15:31:05&00:15:32:30#Forget it, Scott!
00:15:35:97&00:15:37:68#Guess who's drunk?
00:15:38:31&00:15:39:98#I guess Wallace.
00:15:40:81&00:15:41:85#You guess right.
00:15:45:52&00:15:46:90#So, that girl from my dream...
00:15:46:98&00:15:48:23#Girl. Okay.
00:15:48:32&00:15:49:74#I saw her at the library.
00:15:49:82&00:15:52:45#Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?
00:15:52:53&00:15:55:41#And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.
00:15:55:49&00:15:56:74#Hey, there he is.
00:15:56:83&00:15:57:78#I think she's...
00:15:57:87&00:15:58:91#I think he's...
00:15:59:00&00:16:01:12#I think she's the girl of my dreams.
00:16:01:21&00:16:02:21#Mmm.
00:16:02:37&00:16:04:67#Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.
00:16:04:75&00:16:06:46#I've never been so sure about something.
00:16:06:54&00:16:09:05#Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.
00:16:09:38&00:16:10:42#What's that?
00:16:10:51&00:16:13:43#You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.
00:16:13:51&00:16:14:84#I'm not getting it, friend.
00:16:16:64&00:16:17:85#You're thinking of juggling two chicks?
00:16:17:93&00:16:18:97#Not even!
00:16:19:06&00:16:21:39#Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.
00:16:21:48&00:16:22:52#Wait, who told you?
00:16:22:60&00:16:23:89#Wallace. Duh!
00:16:23:98&00:16:25:69#He's not even conscious.
Whatever.
00:16:25:77&00:16:28:69#You of all people should know how
sucky it is to get cheated on.
00:16:28:78&00:16:29:94#Don't you have a job to do?
00:16:30:03&00:16:32:78#You're right. I should send out
a mass text about this. Bye.
00:16:36:28&00:16:37:95#Wallace, how do you do that?
00:16:38:03&00:16:39:33#Wallace!
00:16:40:20&00:16:42:25#Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?
00:16:42:66&00:16:44:79#"Amazon.ca."
00:16:44:87&00:16:47:13#I have to order something really cool.
00:16:47:21&00:16:48:88#You've got mail.
00:16:48:96&00:16:50:38#Dude, this thing claims I have mail.
00:16:50:67&00:16:52:92#It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.
00:16:53:22&00:16:54:47#Dude, now I'm reading it.
00:16:54:55&00:16:55:88#So happy for you.
00:16:56:55&00:16:58:51#"Dear Mr. Pilgrim,
it has come to my attention

00:17:17:99&00:17:19:62#Delete.
00:17:23:58&00:17:24:58#Scott,
00:17:25:54&00:17:28:04#are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?
00:17:28:50&00:17:29:71#Maybe.
00:17:29:79&00:17:32:84#It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.
00:17:32:92&00:17:34:38#You were saying?
00:17:35:51&00:17:36:55#Attack hug!
Hey!
00:17:36:63&00:17:39:68#Attack hug.
That's so cute. So cute.
00:17:39:76&00:17:40:76#You don't remember?
00:17:40:85&00:17:43:43#You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

00:18:56:67&00:18:57:67#That's right.
00:18:57:76&00:19:00:30#This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"
00:19:00:38&00:19:02:09#And I was like,
"I'm in a band."
00:19:02:18&00:19:03:85#And he was like,
"You're in a band?"
00:19:03:93&00:19:06:26#And I was like, "Yeah,
I am totally in a band."
00:19:06:35&00:19:07:43#Great story, man.
00:19:07:52&00:19:08:85#Is there a prize or something?

00:19:39:67&00:19:40:80#I hate them.
00:19:40:88&00:19:42:18#Oh, my gosh,
I hate them, too.

00:20:28:14&00:20:29:56#Uh, Scott Pilgrim?
00:20:29:64&00:20:31:27#Hi, I was thinking about asking you out,
00:20:31:35&00:20:33:10#but then I realized how
stupid that would be.
00:20:33:39&00:20:34:73#So, do you want to go out sometime?
00:20:35:52&00:20:37:86#No, that's okay.
You can just sign for this, all right?
00:20:37:94&00:20:39:90#I just woke up,
and you were in my dream.
00:20:39:98&00:20:42:82#I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?
00:20:43:07&00:20:44:15#It's not weird at all.
00:20:44:24&00:20:45:24#It's not?
00:20:45:32&00:20:46:62#No, it's just that you
have this really convenient

your head that I like to use.
00:20:48:78&00:20:50:33#It's, like,

00:20:51:45&00:20:53:25#I forgot you guys don't
have that in Canada.
00:20:53:54&00:20:54:54#You don't
remember me, do you?
00:20:54:62&00:20:55:75#We met at the party the other day.
00:20:56:00&00:20:57:79#Were you the Pac-Man guy?
No.
00:20:57:88&00:20:59:88#Not even.
That was some total ass.
00:21:00:09&00:21:01:55#I was the other guy.
00:21:01:63&00:21:03:88#You know, you need to sign for this,
whatever this is.
00:21:03:97&00:21:05:09#But if I sign for it,
you'll leave.
00:21:05:18&00:21:06:30#Yeah, it's how it works.
00:21:06:39&00:21:08:30#Okay, well, maybe,
00:21:08:39&00:21:11:18#do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?
00:21:11:27&00:21:13:22#You're the new kid on the block, right?
00:21:13:31&00:21:18:52#I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.
00:21:20:02&00:21:21:48#You want me to hang out with you?
00:21:23:11&00:21:24:65#Yeah, if that's cool.
00:21:25:11&00:21:27:99#If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?
00:21:29:49&00:21:30:87#So, yeah, 8:00?
00:21:34:33&00:21:36:00#Why are you just standing there?
00:21:36:21&00:21:38:12#Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
00:21:38:21&00:21:40:71#I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.
00:21:40:80&00:21:42:63#Oh, you assumed wrong.
00:21:43:80&00:21:46:01#So, how did you end up in Toronto?
00:21:46:09&00:21:47:43#Just needed
to escape, I guess.
00:21:47:55&00:21:48:89#Yeah.
00:21:48:97&00:21:50:60#I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said
00:21:50:68&00:21:53:14#Toronto was one of the
great cities, so...
00:21:53:22&00:21:55:27#Is Gideon your boyfriend?
00:21:55:60&00:21:58:35#He's a friend.
00:21:59:40&00:22:01:11#Was he your boyfriend?
00:22:01:44&00:22:03:61#Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?
00:22:03:69&00:22:06:07#It's so not interesting to me.
00:22:06:53&00:22:08:91#So, what about you?
What do you do?
00:22:08:99&00:22:11:03#I'm in between jobs at the moment.
00:22:11:16&00:22:13:16#Between what and what?
00:22:13:24&00:22:18:37#Well, my last job was a long
story filled with sighs.
00:22:18:75&00:22:20:54#I know plenty of those.
00:22:20:63&00:22:21:88#Is that why you left New York?
00:22:21:96&00:22:23:55#Pretty much.
00:22:23:63&00:22:25:67#It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.
00:22:26:22&00:22:27:84#Well, it's certainly chilled here.
00:22:27:93&00:22:29:13#Yeah.
00:22:29:22&00:22:31:55#It's chilled,
as in cold.
00:22:31:80&00:22:33:05#Yeah.
00:22:35:52&00:22:38:52#This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?
00:22:38:60&00:22:39:69#I know.
00:22:39:77&00:22:41:73#I can barely see you.
00:22:41:81&00:22:44:48#This whole thing is an
unmitigated disaster.
00:22:44:57&00:22:48:40#I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.
00:22:48:49&00:22:50:36#So this is a date, eh?
00:22:50:49&00:22:52:41#Did I say date?
00:22:52:91&00:22:54:37#Slip of the tongue.
00:22:54:45&00:22:55:99#Tongue.
00:22:56:08&00:22:58:66#Anyway, night's not over yet.
00:22:58:75&00:23:00:67#I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.
00:23:00:75&00:23:01:75#A thingy?
00:23:02:75&00:23:04:46#A door.
00:23:07:76&00:23:09:01#Come on.
00:23:24:69&00:23:25:94#What kind of tea do you want?
00:23:26:28&00:23:27:53#There's more than one kind?
00:23:28:78&00:23:31:28#We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,
00:23:31:36&00:23:32:49#green tea,
green tea with lemon,
00:23:32:57&00:23:34:07#green tea with lemon and honey,
liver disaster,
00:23:34:16&00:23:35:49#ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,
00:23:35:58&00:23:37:54#vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,
00:23:37:62&00:23:39:91#vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment
00:23:40:25&00:23:41:54#and Earl Grey.
00:23:41:96&00:23:43:42#Did you make some of those up?
00:23:44:00&00:23:45:92#I think I'll have Sleepytime.
00:23:46:17&00:23:47:59#That sounds good to me.
00:23:49:76&00:23:50:88#Let me get you a blanket.
00:23:51:26&00:23:54:14#That would actually be awesome.
00:24:04:81&00:24:05:98#Dude, I'm changing.
00:24:06:61&00:24:08:82#Sorry.
I'm just cold.
00:24:08:90&00:24:10:94#Here, does that help?
00:24:11:03&00:24:13:70#Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?
00:24:14:57&00:24:16:49#Okay.
00:24:32:30&00:24:35:68#Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?
00:24:35:76&00:24:37:01#I guess.
00:24:37:10&00:24:41:68#Maybe we should both get under it,
since we're so cold.
00:24:43:02&00:24:45:02#What about our tea?
00:24:46:86&00:24:48:27#I can
00:24:49:32&00:24:51:07#not have tea.
00:24:59:03&00:25:00:62#I changed my mind.
00:25:00:70&00:25:03:29#Changed it to what?
From what?
00:25:03:37&00:25:06:88#I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.
00:25:06:96&00:25:08:79#Okay.
00:25:08:88&00:25:11:13#It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.
00:25:11:21&00:25:12:76#You can sleep in my bed.
00:25:12:84&00:25:15:72#And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.
00:25:15:80&00:25:19:39#Well, this is nice.
Just this.
00:25:19:47&00:25:21:93#It's been, like,
a really long time,
00:25:22:02&00:25:24:43#so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,
00:25:24:52&00:25:26:60#so thank you.
00:25:28:52&00:25:30:44#You're welcome.
00:25:33:40&00:25:36:91#Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?
00:25:36:99&00:25:39:70#For one thing, I didn't even get any.
That was a joke.
00:25:40:74&00:25:41:91#What did you have in mind?
00:25:42:54&00:25:44:95#Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.
00:25:45:04&00:25:46:25#You have a band?
00:25:46:33&00:25:47:62#Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?
00:25:48:13&00:25:49:58#Sure.
00:25:50:09&00:25:52:80#Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?
00:25:54:42&00:25:56:42#Wow. Girl number.
00:25:57:18&00:25:58:97#See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.
00:25:59:47&00:26:00:93#Hey, it's tonight.
At the...
00:26:06:06&00:26:08:65#Hey.
You totally came.
00:26:09:10&00:26:11:77#Yes.
I did totally come.
00:26:17:03&00:26:19:57#Please excuse my brother.
He is chronically enfeebled.
00:26:19:66&00:26:21:07#I'm Stacey.
Hey.
00:26:21:16&00:26:22:74#This is Wallace,
his roommate. Hey.
00:26:22:83&00:26:24:08#This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.
00:26:24:16&00:26:25:16#Hey.
00:26:25:79&00:26:27:25#Oh, and this is Knives.
00:26:27:33&00:26:29:08#Hey!
Hey!
00:26:33:80&00:26:35:38#So, do you like?
00:26:35:46&00:26:37:47#Well, I...
00:26:47:94&00:26:50:52#Have to go.
00:26:52:98&00:26:56:07#Okay, this next band is from Brampton,
00:26:56:15&00:26:59:74#and they are Crash and the Boys.
00:27:00:95&00:27:02:87#God!
This is a nightmare.
00:27:03:87&00:27:06:20#Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
00:27:06:29&00:27:07:66#Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.
00:27:07:75&00:27:11:17#We were just on stage for sound check,
and the sound guy hated us.
00:27:11:25&00:27:14:46#It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.
00:27:14:55&00:27:15:71#People love us, right?
00:27:15:80&00:27:17:05#Oh, man,
this is bad.
00:27:17:59&00:27:19:63#This is so, so bad.
00:27:19:88&00:27:22:93#Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?
00:27:23:93&00:27:26:51#They have not started playing yet.
00:27:27:27&00:27:29:14#That was a test, Jimmy.
- One, two.
00:27:29:39&00:27:30:77#You passed.
00:27:30:89&00:27:32:27#Okay.
00:27:32:35&00:27:33:60#Good evening.
00:27:33:69&00:27:35:98#My name is Crash.
These are the Boys.
00:27:36:07&00:27:37:78#Is that girl a boy, too?
00:27:37:86&00:27:38:86#Yes.
00:27:40:40&00:27:42:11#They have a girl drummer?
00:27:42:20&00:27:46:74#This song is called I Am So Sad,
I Am So Very Very Sad.
00:27:46:83&00:27:48:20#Goes a little something like this.
00:27:51:00&00:27:53:54#So sad!
00:27:54:84&00:27:55:88#Thank you.
00:27:56:13&00:27:58:34#It's not a race, guys.
00:27:58:42&00:27:59:92#All right, this next song
goes out to the guy
00:28:00:01&00:28:01:51#who keeps yelling from the balcony.
00:28:01:63&00:28:03:68#It's called
We Hate You, Please Die.
00:28:03:76&00:28:05:64#Sweet.
Love this one.
00:28:16:57&00:28:18:07#I can feel ya,
I can hear ya...
00:28:33:92&00:28:35:04#Thank you.
00:28:36:25&00:28:38:92#So, how do you know Scott?
00:28:39:92&00:28:41:55#He's a friend.
00:28:42:51&00:28:44:09#It's hard for me to
keep track sometimes,
00:28:44:18&00:28:46:30#because he has so many friends.
00:28:47:72&00:28:51:02#Knives, how did you meet Scott?
00:28:51:10&00:28:52:31#Well...
00:28:53:10&00:28:54:27#Oh, no.
00:28:56:36&00:28:58:77#This is a nightmare.
00:29:01:36&00:29:02:74#We need to play now and loud.
00:29:02:82&00:29:03:86#Okay.
00:29:03:95&00:29:07:32#So, I was on the bus with my mom...
00:29:09:28&00:29:11:29#Is that seriously the end of the story?
00:29:11:66&00:29:12:79#Oh, my gosh!
00:29:12:87&00:29:13:87#Okay.
00:29:13:96&00:29:15:04#They're on!
00:29:15:12&00:29:17:00#This next band is from Toronto.
00:29:17:08&00:29:22:63#And, yeah.
Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.
00:29:22:71&00:29:24:55#I heart you,
Sex Bob-Omb!
00:29:27:26&00:29:28:51#Scott, are you ready?
00:29:28:60&00:29:30:05#Okay. Kim?
Are you...
00:29:30:14&00:29:33:81#We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!
00:29:41:69&00:29:44:65#I'll take you for a ride
00:29:45:45&00:29:47:82#On my garbage truck
00:29:49:99&00:29:51:49#Oh, no
00:29:52:49&00:29:54:83#I'll take you to the dump
00:29:56:71&00:29:59:42#'Cause you're my queen
00:30:00:34&00:30:02:84#I'll take you uptown
00:30:04:01&00:30:07:97#I'll show you the sites
You know you wanna ride
00:30:09:18&00:30:10:93#On my garbage truck
00:30:12:64&00:30:14:14#Truck, truck, truck
00:30:14:68&00:30:17:60#We'll pass the mansions by
00:30:17:69&00:30:21:11#Drive right through the needle's eye
00:30:21:19&00:30:22:27#Oh, my
00:30:22:36&00:30:23:44#Oh, no... My...
00:30:23:57&00:30:25:65#My, my, my, my
00:30:28:86&00:30:30:87#I've got a stereo
00:30:32:03&00:30:34:99#You've just got to turn the knob
00:30:35:08&00:30:38:33#And maybe we'll go
00:30:38:42&00:30:40:63#As far as we can
00:30:41:46&00:30:43:71#I'll be your garbage man
00:30:45:21&00:30:47:55#I'll take out your junk
00:30:48:76&00:30:50:13#And I'll crush it...
00:30:52:05&00:30:53:72#Mr. Pilgrim.
00:30:55:10&00:30:58:89#It is I,
Matthew Patel.
00:30:59:73&00:31:02:61#Consider our fight begun.
00:31:04:07&00:31:05:48#What did I do?
00:31:06:78&00:31:08:82#What do I do?
00:31:10:57&00:31:11:78#Fight!
00:31:24:38&00:31:29:30#All right.
00:31:29:38&00:31:31:93#Watch out!
It's that one guy.
00:32:04:67&00:32:06:29#Well, well, well,
00:32:07:38&00:32:10:38#you're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.
00:32:10:47&00:32:11:88#Who the hell are you, anyway?
00:32:11:97&00:32:14:97#My name is Matthew Patel!
00:32:15:35&00:32:20:77#And I'm Ramona's first
evil ex-boyfriend.
00:32:22:69&00:32:23:69#Her what?
00:32:25:27&00:32:26:73#Anyone need another drink?
00:32:38:20&00:32:40:24#Wait. We're fighting
over Ramona?
00:32:41:08&00:32:43:66#Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?
00:32:44:08&00:32:45:12#I skimmed it.
00:32:45:42&00:32:46:42#Mmm-mmm.
00:32:46:50&00:32:48:96#You will pay for your insolence!
00:33:13:45&00:33:15:74#Hey, what's up with his outfit?
00:33:16:28&00:33:18:62#Yeah, is he a pirate?
00:33:19:41&00:33:20:53#Are you a pirate?
00:33:20:62&00:33:22:04#Pirates are in this year.
00:33:31:38&00:33:32:92#You really went out with this guy?
00:33:34:55&00:33:35:84#Yeah.
00:33:36:93&00:33:38:93#In the seventh grade.
00:33:40:06&00:33:41:14#And?
00:33:44:43&00:33:47:31#It was football season
and for some reason,
00:33:47:40&00:33:49:06#all the little jocks wanted me.
00:33:50:65&00:33:53:82#Matthew was the only non-white,
non-jock boy in town.
00:33:53:90&00:33:57:53#So, the two of us joined forces
and we took 'em all down.
00:33:57:61&00:34:01:20#We brawled and scrapped
and fought for hours.
00:34:01:28&00:34:03:45#Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers.
00:34:04:75&00:34:06:21#We only kissed once.
00:34:06:29&00:34:09:46#After a week and a half,
I told him to hit the showers.
00:34:09:79&00:34:12:13#Dude, wait.
Mystical powers?
00:34:14:59&00:34:18:09#You'll pay for this, Flowers.
00:34:18:93&00:34:21:85#If you want to fight me
00:34:21:93&00:34:22:97#What?
00:34:23:10&00:34:25:73#Ha!
You're not the brightest
00:34:26:39&00:34:31:06#You won't know what hit
you in the slightest
00:34:36:28&00:34:37:36#This guy's good.
00:34:37:45&00:34:39:78#Me and my fireballs
00:34:40:78&00:34:42:62#My Demon Hipster Chicks
00:34:42:91&00:34:44:20#Tell him, Matty.
Tell him, Matty.
00:34:45:00&00:34:46:41#I'm talking the talk
00:34:46:50&00:34:49:54#Because I know I'm slick
00:34:49:62&00:34:50:88#S-L-ick
00:34:51:88&00:34:53:25#Fireballs
00:34:53:71&00:34:55:67#Take this sucker down
00:34:58:72&00:35:04:01#Let us show him what we're all about
00:35:04:35&00:35:06:27#That doesn't even rhyme.
00:35:09:48&00:35:12:65#This is impossible.
How can this be?
00:35:12:73&00:35:15:94#Open your eyes,
maybe you'll see.
00:35:18:36&00:35:19:90#K-O!
00:35:28:08&00:35:29:71#Sweet! Coins.
00:35:29:92&00:35:31:58#God, is that allowed?
00:35:32:67&00:35:35:29#Well, it was nice meeting you.
00:35:35:38&00:35:37:84#Tell your gay friends I said bye.
00:35:37:92&00:35:39:38#Gay friends?
00:35:40:63&00:35:41:80#Wallace! Again?
00:35:42:30&00:35:44:14#- Get a room, guys!
- Oh, my God!
00:35:44:93&00:35:48:52#Oh, man, $2.40?
That's not even enough for the bus home.
00:35:48:60&00:35:50:77#I'll lend you the 35 cents.
00:35:50:85&00:35:54:44#Yeah, so,
Sex Bob-Omb wins.
00:35:56:36&00:35:58:23#Sex Bob-Omb won?
00:36:05:41&00:36:08:87#So, what was all that all about?
00:36:11:04&00:36:13:04#I guess
00:36:14:29&00:36:17:29#if we're gonna date, you may have
to defeat my seven evil exes.
00:36:17:38&00:36:18:63#You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
00:36:18:71&00:36:19:88#Seven evil exes, yes.
00:36:19:97&00:36:21:51#And I have to fight... Defeat.
00:36:21:59&00:36:26:14#Defeat your seven evil exes if
we're going to continue to date?
00:36:26:22&00:36:27:26#Pretty much.
00:36:27:35&00:36:32:06#So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?
00:36:34:40&00:36:35:40#I guess.
00:36:35:48&00:36:36:61#Does that mean we can make out?
00:36:37:94&00:36:38:94#Sure.
00:36:39:03&00:36:40:15#Cool.
00:36:50:83&00:36:52:08#Someone's happy.
00:36:52:16&00:36:54:50#Well, someone got to
second base last night.
00:36:54:58&00:36:57:84#And someone has a second date tonight.
00:36:57:92&00:36:59:55#Someone's lucky, then.
00:37:00:92&00:37:02:76#You know when I say "someone,"
I mean "me," right?
00:37:02:84&00:37:04:22#I got to second base last night.
00:37:05:64&00:37:06:64#Maybe first-and-a-half.
00:37:09:31&00:37:13:85#So, I invited Ramona over for dinner
tonight, so you can't be here.
00:37:13:94&00:37:15:48#I don't want you gaying up the place.
00:37:17:44&00:37:19:15#Okay, Scott.
00:37:19:77&00:37:21:90#But in return,
I have to issue an ultimatum.
00:37:22:19&00:37:23:61#One of your famous ultimatums?
00:37:23:70&00:37:25:57#It may live in infamy.
00:37:26:57&00:37:30:62#You have to break up with Knives,
that poor angel, today.
00:37:32:62&00:37:34:87#But it's hard.
00:37:34:96&00:37:37:37#If you don't,
I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives.
00:37:37:46&00:37:38:50#I swear to God, Scott.
00:37:38:59&00:37:39:63#What? You...
00:37:40:46&00:37:41:46#Hi. Morning.
00:37:41:55&00:37:43:21#Hey, Jimmy.
Double standard!
00:37:43:30&00:37:44:72#I didn't make up the gay rulebook.
00:37:44:80&00:37:46:18#You got a problem with it... Stop.
00:37:46:30&00:37:47:72#Take it up with Liberace's ghost.
00:37:47:80&00:37:48:89#You're a monster.
00:37:48:97&00:37:50:64#Give me the bacon,
and go do your dirt
00:37:50:72&00:37:51:93#while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.
00:37:52:14&00:37:53:10#Who's Lucas Lee?
00:37:53:18&00:37:54:18#Oh!
00:37:55:06&00:37:56:52#He was this pretty good skater.
00:37:56:60&00:37:57:98#Now he's this pretty good actor.
00:37:58:06&00:38:00:06#He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.
00:38:00:15&00:38:01:27#They make movies in Toronto?
00:38:01:40&00:38:02:48#Yes.
00:38:02:57&00:38:04:11#I'm stalking him later.
00:38:04:19&00:38:05:19#So, this Lucas Lee...
00:38:05:28&00:38:07:32#Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.
00:38:10:33&00:38:11:49#You suck.
00:38:11:58&00:38:12:79#Out.
00:38:12:95&00:38:13:99#Surprising no one.
00:38:14:08&00:38:15:08#Out.
00:38:17:33&00:38:20:08#Now, you listen close,
and you listen hard, bucko.
00:38:20:17&00:38:22:59#The next click you'll
hear is me hanging up.
00:38:22:67&00:38:26:97#The one after that is
me pulling the trigger.
00:38:30:64&00:38:31:68#Hey, Knives.
00:38:32:81&00:38:35:52#Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?
00:38:35:60&00:38:40:85#Are you wearing a tan jacket, like,
a spring jacket, and a hoodie?
00:38:41:56&00:38:43:48#And a dorky hat?
00:38:43:57&00:38:45:65#It's not dorky.
Why are you psychic?
00:38:45:74&00:38:46:78#Hey!
00:38:46:86&00:38:48:11#Hey. Hey.
00:38:49:82&00:38:50:95#Hey.
00:38:52:37&00:38:54:24#Oh, my God.
00:38:54:33&00:38:58:29#I can't believe TCAD's coming to town.
Will you take me to the show?
00:38:58:37&00:39:00:67#Yeah, listen...
00:39:00:75&00:39:04:21#Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.
00:39:04:55&00:39:06:30#Like, Chinese food?
00:39:06:38&00:39:09:13#To meet my parents.
It's my birthday dinner.
00:39:09:22&00:39:11:76#I think that's a really bad idea.
00:39:12:22&00:39:14:68#No, it's okay. Why?
00:39:14:76&00:39:16:35#I'm too old for you.
00:39:16:43&00:39:19:69#No, you're not.
My dad is nine years older than my mom.
00:39:19:77&00:39:22:98#Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?
00:39:23:11&00:39:26:03#I don't care. I'm...
00:39:27:36&00:39:28:74#I'm in...
00:39:35:12&00:39:36:41#Uh...
00:39:37:08&00:39:38:45#Listen,
00:39:39:75&00:39:41:46#I was thinking
00:39:42:79&00:39:46:13#we should break up or whatever.
00:39:48:30&00:39:49:38#Really?
00:39:49:76&00:39:50:97#Yeah.
00:39:52:09&00:39:54:05#It's not gonna work out.
00:39:56:81&00:39:57:81#Oh.
00:40:27:46&00:40:29:42#Where's Knives.
Not coming tonight?
00:40:29:51&00:40:30:55#No, we broke up.
00:40:30:63&00:40:33:22#Hey, check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy II.
00:40:38:64&00:40:40:56#Scott, you are the salt of the earth.
00:40:40:64&00:40:41:64#Thanks.
00:40:42:23&00:40:43:52#I meant scum of the earth.
00:40:43:94&00:40:44:94#Thanks.
00:40:45:02&00:40:46:40#You broke up with Knives?
00:40:46:48&00:40:48:23#Yeah, but don't worry.
00:40:48:32&00:40:50:82#Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.
00:40:50:90&00:40:51:94#New-new.
00:40:53:70&00:40:58:41#Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.
00:40:58:49&00:41:00:16#Whether they're old, new, or
00:41:00:25&00:41:01:37#New-new.
New-new.
00:41:01:45&00:41:03:75#We were lucky to survive the last round.
00:41:03:83&00:41:05:46#It's sudden death now, okay?
00:41:05:54&00:41:06:75#Okay.
00:41:13:80&00:41:15:76#That's for me.
That's for me. That's for me.
00:41:15:84&00:41:18:51#Hey, you're here.
00:41:19:56&00:41:21:31#Yes, like you said.
00:41:22:98&00:41:23:98#You know your hair?
00:41:24:06&00:41:25:10#I know of it.
00:41:25:19&00:41:26:31#It's all blue.
00:41:26:40&00:41:29:57#I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.
00:41:30:57&00:41:32:03#So...
00:41:33:32&00:41:34:74#How do you guys all know each other?
00:41:35:82&00:41:38:03#High school,
I guess.
00:41:38:12&00:41:39:41#What Neil said.
00:41:39:53&00:41:40:66#I'm Neil.
00:41:40:74&00:41:43:45#Believe it or not,
I actually dated Scott in high school.
00:41:43:71&00:41:45:25#Got any embarrassing stories?
00:41:45:33&00:41:46:96#Yeah, he's an idiot.
00:41:47:29&00:41:49:00#Okay, bye.
See you guys tomorrow.
00:41:49:09&00:41:50:13#What about rehearsal?
00:41:50:25&00:41:51:30#Neil knows my parts.
00:41:53:38&00:41:54:88#I'm Neil.
00:42:03:14&00:42:04:14#You doing okay, there?
00:42:04:23&00:42:05:85#Yeah, good, good, good.
00:42:09:06&00:42:10:23#She changed her hair.
00:42:10:40&00:42:11:57#So?
It looks nice blue.
00:42:11:65&00:42:13:07#Yeah, I know,
but she did it without even making
00:42:13:15&00:42:14:28#a big deal of it or anything.
00:42:14:36&00:42:17:07#She's fickle.
Impulsive. Spontaneous.
00:42:17:28&00:42:18:74#God, what am I gonna do?
00:42:19:03&00:42:22:99#Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.
00:42:23:08&00:42:25:00#So, how's dinner coming along?
00:42:25:08&00:42:26:91#Yeah, good, good, good.
00:42:28:42&00:42:31:50#Okay, well,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds to it.
00:42:31:59&00:42:35:17#I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.
00:42:35:26&00:42:36:30#Don't go!
00:42:36:38&00:42:37:76#Will you man the hell up?
00:42:37:84&00:42:39:22#You can get to second
and a half base tonight.
00:42:39:30&00:42:40:43#You think so?
00:42:40:51&00:42:43:43#Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.
00:42:43:72&00:42:44:77#If I strike out?
00:42:44:85&00:42:46:18#Okay, when.
See you in 60.
00:42:51:23&00:42:52:69#This is actually really
good garlic bread.
00:42:52:77&00:42:54:36#Garlic bread is my favorite food.
00:42:54:44&00:42:56:15#I could honestly eat it for every meal.
00:42:56:44&00:42:58:90#Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.
00:42:58:99&00:43:00:07#You'd get fat.
00:43:00:20&00:43:01:28#No, why would I get fat?
00:43:01:37&00:43:02:41#Bread makes you fat.
00:43:02:49&00:43:03:74#Bread makes you fat?
00:43:06:58&00:43:07:79#I wrote a song about you.
00:43:07:91&00:43:08:96#You did?
00:43:09:04&00:43:10:12#Yeah, it goes like this.
00:43:10:79&00:43:13:88#Ramona
00:43:17:38&00:43:20:30#Ramona
00:43:22:01&00:43:24:43#On my mind
00:43:25:64&00:43:29:60#Ramona
00:43:35:02&00:43:36:44#Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.
00:43:37:19&00:43:38:32#Finished?
00:43:45:03&00:43:46:49#Your hair's pretty shaggy.
00:43:46:58&00:43:48:58#Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?
00:43:48:66&00:43:49:62#What?
00:43:49:71&00:43:51:00#No, sorry. I just...
00:43:51:33&00:43:54:84#I got a bad haircut right before
me and my big ex broke up,
00:43:54:92&00:43:57:42#but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.
00:43:57:51&00:44:00:26#Scott is acutely aware that his
last salon haircut took place
00:44:00:34&00:44:04:18#exactly 431 days ago,
three hours before his big breakup.
00:44:04:26&00:44:06:43#He's been cutting his
own hair ever since.
00:44:06:51&00:44:07:64#So long ago.
00:44:09:06&00:44:10:31#Sounds like a bad time.
00:44:10:39&00:44:12:23#Bad time?
Not really.
00:44:12:31&00:44:13:40#It was.
00:44:13:48&00:44:14:69#It was a mutual thing.
00:44:14:77&00:44:15:86#It wasn't.
00:44:15:94&00:44:18:90#I mean,
she told me it was mutual.
00:44:18:99&00:44:21:36#She dumped him.
It was brutal.
00:44:21:45&00:44:22:65#What was her name?
00:44:22:74&00:44:24:03#She was Nat,
when I knew her,
00:44:24:12&00:44:26:20#but she stopped liking that name.
00:44:26:28&00:44:27:95#Then she stopped liking me.
00:44:28:04&00:44:29:91#Your hair is cute.
I like it long.
00:44:30:00&00:44:31:79#But it would be cuter short,
wouldn't it?
00:44:31:87&00:44:33:71#What?
What?
00:44:34:42&00:44:35:46#Why are you wearing that hat?
00:44:35:54&00:44:36:75#I thought we could go for a walk.
00:44:38:50&00:44:39:92#Tell me we didn't come
out here in the cold
00:44:40:01&00:44:41:30#so you could cover your
hair with that hat.
00:44:41:38&00:44:43:97#No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.
00:44:44:05&00:44:49:06#Just putting one leg in front of
the other, like this. Walking.
00:44:49:14&00:44:51:10#You seem a little heightened.
00:44:51:89&00:44:53:23#Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
00:44:53:31&00:44:55:90#I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.
00:44:55:98&00:44:57:48#Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,
00:44:57:57&00:44:59:48#in which case I do drugs all the time.
00:44:59:57&00:45:00:57#Every drug.
00:45:01:36&00:45:04:32#Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,
00:45:04:41&00:45:07:12#things sort of seem a little brighter.
00:45:07:20&00:45:08:20#What is this place?
00:45:08:28&00:45:09:83#It's a totally awesome castle.
00:45:09:95&00:45:11:50#They're shooting this
movie here right now.
00:45:11:58&00:45:14:21#Okay, everybody, let's do this.
Lots to do, everyone.
00:45:14:29&00:45:15:29#Lots to do.
00:45:15:38&00:45:17:13#Did you find the guy you were stalking?
00:45:17:21&00:45:18:84#I think I'm about to right now.
00:45:18:92&00:45:20:50#Mr. Lee is traveling.
00:45:20:59&00:45:21:63#Mr. Lee?
00:45:21:71&00:45:23:05#Lucas Lee.
00:45:23:13&00:45:24:13#Oh.
00:45:24:63&00:45:25:63#Oh?
00:45:25:72&00:45:27:34#And roll sound.
00:45:34:10&00:45:36:44#I wanna have his adopted babies.
00:45:37:65&00:45:38:77#Here we go.
00:45:40:57&00:45:42:28#All right,
on your marks, everyone.
00:45:42:36&00:45:43:69#Oh, man,
we got to go.
00:45:43:95&00:45:45:03#What? Why?
00:45:45:11&00:45:47:41#I used to date that clown.
00:45:47:49&00:45:48:53#And...
00:45:48:62&00:45:49:66#Action.
00:45:49:99&00:45:51:58#Oh, my God.
00:45:51:66&00:45:52:83#Hey.
00:45:53:58&00:45:55:25#The only thing keeping me and her apart
00:45:55:33&00:45:57:62#is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.
00:45:57:71&00:45:59:38#You dated a famous guy?
00:45:59:46&00:46:01:17#In ninth grade.
We had drama.
00:46:01:25&00:46:02:55#Actually, it might have been math.
00:46:02:67&00:46:04:01#I just remember there
being a lot of drama.
00:46:04:09&00:46:05:05#Hey!
00:46:05:13&00:46:07:05#He was a snot-nosed little brat.
He just followed me around.
00:46:07:14&00:46:09:89#He had snot in his nose?
But he's famous.
00:46:09:97&00:46:12:47#Hey! I'm talking to you,
Scott Pilgrim.
00:46:12:56&00:46:14:14#He's famous and he talked to me.
00:46:14:39&00:46:16:35#The only thing keeping me and her apart
00:46:16:44&00:46:18:98#is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.
00:46:19:19&00:46:21:77#Can I have your...
Can I have your autograph, please?
00:46:25:19&00:46:26:24#What's up?
00:46:26:32&00:46:28:53#How's life?
He seems nice.
00:46:32:03&00:46:33:37#Boom!
00:46:36:96&00:46:38:96#And that's a cut!
00:46:39:83&00:46:43:38#Scott, evil ex.
Fight.
00:46:43:46&00:46:46:09#Let's get ready to go again, please.
Let's get ready to go again.
00:46:46:17&00:46:47:80#Hey, hombre.
00:46:48:84&00:46:51:80#You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?
00:46:55:48&00:46:57:93#Some competish you are.
00:46:59:52&00:47:00:52#Hey!
00:47:01:48&00:47:02:65#Hey!
00:47:03:77&00:47:05:69#Hey, I'm not done with you.
00:47:09:32&00:47:11:20#Looks like you're seeing double.
00:47:13:20&00:47:14:20#He's good, right?
00:47:14:54&00:47:16:24#Sometimes I let him do the wide shots
00:47:16:62&00:47:19:92#when I feel like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.
00:47:25:00&00:47:26:25#What can I say?
00:47:27:88&00:47:29:88#I'm nothing without my stunt team.
00:47:35:72&00:47:38:68#Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.
00:47:38:77&00:47:39:77#How does it...
00:48:14:14&00:48:16:14#Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?
00:48:16:26&00:48:18:10#No, I just ate.
Negative.
00:48:25:27&00:48:27:44#That's actually hilarious.
00:48:28:07&00:48:29:11#Ah.
00:48:29:19&00:48:30:61#Hilarious.
00:48:31:86&00:48:33:45#Mr. Lee!
00:48:38:20&00:48:40:12#You're needed back on set.
00:49:07:65&00:49:09:15#Prepare...
00:49:09:98&00:49:13:99#Prepare to feel the wrath
of the League of Evil Exes.
00:49:14:20&00:49:15:82#The League of Evil Axes?
00:49:16:41&00:49:17:70#You really don't know about the League?
00:49:19:12&00:49:22:16#The seven evil exes?
Coming to kill you?
00:49:22:66&00:49:25:54#Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?
00:49:25:63&00:49:26:75#No.
00:49:26:83&00:49:28:50#Oh, well, hey, listen, man.
Don't worry about it.
00:49:28:92&00:49:30:46#Really? Yeah.
Let's go get a beer.
00:49:30:55&00:49:31:55#That's great...
00:49:31:63&00:49:32:96#Boom!
00:49:36:55&00:49:38:26#You are a pretty good actor.
00:49:38:35&00:49:39:68#I'm going for the Oscar this year.
00:49:40:93&00:49:42:89#But are you a pretty good skater?
00:49:42:98&00:49:45:14#I'm more than pretty good, ese.
00:49:45:35&00:49:47:23#I have my own skate company.
00:49:47:81&00:49:51:78#But can you do a thingy on that rail?
00:49:54:28&00:49:56:03#It's called a grind, bro.
00:49:56:11&00:49:59:95#So, can you do a grindy thingy now?
00:50:01:58&00:50:03:37#Are you serious?
00:50:05:62&00:50:08:21#There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.
00:50:08:29&00:50:10:42#Well, hey,
if it's too hardcore then...
00:50:11:05&00:50:14:46#You really think you can goad
me into doing a trick like that?
00:50:14:55&00:50:16:01#There are girls watching.
00:50:18:68&00:50:21:01#Somebody get me my board.
00:50:22:26&00:50:24:39#Hi. Big fan.
00:50:25:98&00:50:27:60#Why wouldn't you be?
00:50:42:66&00:50:58:05#Wow.
00:50:58:34&00:50:59:84#Yes!
He totally bailed.
00:51:01:10&00:51:02:43#Ah! I didn't get
his autograph.
00:51:02:51&00:51:03:56#No.
00:51:03:64&00:51:05:89#And that's a wrap, everybody.
00:51:05:98&00:51:08:85#Hey, where's Ramona.
Is she still here?
00:51:08:94&00:51:11:19#No.
She totally bailed.
00:51:11:27&00:51:13:82#What's the deal?
Seriously.
00:51:13:90&00:51:15:82#Let's move, people,
the sun is coming up.
00:51:17:57&00:51:22:03#Hey, it's me again. Scott.
Give me a call when you get this.
00:51:22:12&00:51:23:87#Scott Pilgrim.
00:51:24:95&00:51:27:37#What's the deal?
Seriously.
00:51:27:46&00:51:29:71#Yep. You said that
last night.
00:51:29:79&00:51:31:00#You know what really sucks, though?
00:51:31:50&00:51:32:50#What?
00:51:33:29&00:51:34:59#Everything.
00:51:34:80&00:51:36:30#Come on, guy.
00:51:36:80&00:51:38:67#You can't say you
didn't see this coming.
00:51:38:76&00:51:39:80#What?
00:51:41:84&00:51:43:26#What did you think these were?
00:51:43:85&00:51:46:81#Kisses?
Seven little kisses?
00:51:46:89&00:51:49:98#Seven deadly X's.
00:51:53:15&00:51:55:90#Why does everything have
to be so complicated?
00:51:56:98&00:51:59:19#If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.
00:51:59:61&00:52:00:99#Step up your game, Scott.
00:52:01:20&00:52:02:53#Break out the L-word.
00:52:02:62&00:52:03:82#"Lesbian?"
00:52:04:12&00:52:05:28#The other L-word.
00:52:06:20&00:52:07:58#"Lesbians?"
00:52:07:66&00:52:10:29#It's "love," Scott.
I wasn't trying to trick you.
00:52:10:37&00:52:12:62#Hey, buddy, look,
00:52:12:96&00:52:15:96#if she really is the
girl of your dreams,
00:52:16:05&00:52:17:50#then you have to let her know.
00:52:17:59&00:52:21:26#You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.
00:52:21:55&00:52:24:43#You can do it. Be with her!
It's your destiny!
00:52:25:51&00:52:27:43#Plus, I need you to move out.
00:52:27:52&00:52:28:60#What?
Yeah.
00:52:28:68&00:52:30:02#I'm kind of banking on
her calling you back
00:52:30:10&00:52:32:44#so I don't have to evict you
and feel all guilty and shit.
00:52:33:60&00:52:34:94#I have a feeling that's for you, guy.
00:52:36:57&00:52:37:57#Hey.
00:52:37:69&00:52:38:69#Hey, Scott.
00:52:38:78&00:52:40:57#Envy?
Oh, shit.
00:52:41:28&00:52:42:40#Been a while.
00:52:42:49&00:52:43:45#Yeah.
00:52:43:53&00:52:44:74#A year, I think.
00:52:44:82&00:52:46:16#Approximately.
00:52:46:37&00:52:47:45#How are you?
00:52:47:54&00:52:48:95#I'm not doing so good right now.
00:52:49:37&00:52:53:46#Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?
00:52:53:54&00:52:57:54#What? No. I've been...
It's been different. You have no idea.
00:52:57:63&00:53:00:17#Probably not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
00:53:00:26&00:53:02:30#Should I be jealous?
00:53:02:38&00:53:04:63#Yes, you should.
I have this totally awesome girlfriend
00:53:04:72&00:53:07:26#who calls me all the
time and she's America.
00:53:07:35&00:53:08:35#She's American.
00:53:08:43&00:53:09:60#What's her name?
00:53:09:68&00:53:11:39#I'm not telling you that.
Ramona.
00:53:11:48&00:53:12:48#Oh.
00:53:12:81&00:53:13:81#What?
Do you know her?
00:53:13:89&00:53:15:31#What? No.
00:53:15:77&00:53:17:19#It sounded like you did.
00:53:17:27&00:53:19:82#I got to go.
It's been nice chatting with you.
00:53:19:90&00:53:21:07#Wait.
00:53:26:87&00:53:28:07#Okay.
00:53:30:49&00:53:31:62#Everything does suck.
00:53:31:79&00:53:34:41#Or does it? Hello?
00:53:35:25&00:53:36:37#Hey, Knives.
00:53:37:75&00:53:40:00#What's that?
You're outside?
00:53:41:09&00:53:42:55#Is Scott here?
00:53:42:63&00:53:45:26#You know what?
He just left.
00:53:47:22&00:53:48:22#Really?
00:53:48:35&00:53:49:39#Yeah.
00:53:51:52&00:53:52:68#Sorry.
00:53:55:77&00:53:57:02#Do you have a girlfriend?
00:53:57:10&00:54:00:15#Seven deadly X's.
00:54:00:44&00:54:02:86#You may have to defeat
my seven evil exes.
00:54:04:03&00:54:06:15#It's sudden death now, okay?
00:54:06:28&00:54:08:49#She's got some battle scars, dude.
00:54:08:57&00:54:10:45#You can't say you
didn't see this coming.
00:54:13:45&00:54:14:66#Dude.
00:54:17:79&00:54:18:79#Please.
00:54:19:79&00:54:21:42#I'm really not in the mood for this.
00:54:23:80&00:54:25:05#Okay, enough!
00:54:31:93&00:54:33:35#You punched me in the boob!
00:54:34:93&00:54:37:02#Prepare to die, obviously.
00:54:37:10&00:54:39:35#Look, I've had it today.
Can we not do this right now?
00:54:39:44&00:54:41:52#I'd love to postpone, darling,
00:54:41:61&00:54:43:90#but I just cashed my last rain check.
00:54:44:23&00:54:45:61#What's that from?
My brain!
00:54:46:49&00:54:49:20#I'm really, really not up for this.
Whatever it is.
00:54:49:28&00:54:52:74#Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.
00:54:52:83&00:54:54:49#But you won't see me,
00:54:54:58&00:54:58:21#because next time,
I'll be deadly serious next time.
00:54:58:54&00:54:59:54#What?
00:54:59:63&00:55:00:75#Never mind!
00:55:02:34&00:55:04:50#Man.
Someone help me.
00:55:05:76&00:55:07:09#Hello.
It's Scott.
00:55:07:17&00:55:08:34#What did he do this time?
00:55:08:43&00:55:09:97#No, it's Scott.
It's actually me.
00:55:10:05&00:55:11:09#What did you do this time?
00:55:11:18&00:55:12:85#I didn't do anything.
It's everyone else that's crazy.
00:55:12:93&00:55:14:93#Look, I'm having a meltdown or whatever.
Are you still working?
00:55:15:02&00:55:16:14#I'm literally about to leave.
00:55:16:23&00:55:17:39#Cool, I'm coming in.
00:55:23:86&00:55:25:36#I think I'll make it a decaf today.
00:55:25:44&00:55:26:69#Scott Pilgrim!
00:55:27:19&00:55:28:53#What did you do with my sister?
00:55:29:70&00:55:31:53#Sorry, I had to go.
00:55:32:07&00:55:33:87#So, what can I get you?
00:55:33:95&00:55:35:20#Is there anywhere you don't work?
00:55:35:29&00:55:38:41#They're called jobs. Something a like
you wouldn't know anything about.
00:55:38:50&00:55:40:71#And by the way, I can't
believe you asked Ramona out
00:55:40:79&00:55:43:33#after I specifically
told you not to do that.
00:55:43:42&00:55:44:79#How are you doing that with your mouth?
00:55:44:88&00:55:46:92#Never mind how I'm doing it!
00:55:47:01&00:55:48:38#What do you have to say for yourself?
00:55:48:72&00:55:50:17#Can I get a caramel macchiato?
00:55:51:18&00:55:53:72#You know what, maybe it's high
time you took a look in a mirror
00:55:53:80&00:55:55:47#before you wreak havoc on another girl.
00:55:55:56&00:55:56:68#Me? Wreak havoc?
00:55:56:77&00:55:57:97#And speaking of which,
00:55:58:06&00:55:59:18#I hear the girl that kicked
your heart in the ass
00:55:59:27&00:56:00:89#is walking the streets of Toronto again.
00:56:02:23&00:56:03:81#So, I can just get my coffee over here?
00:56:07:07&00:56:08:48#Sorry that got a little
crazy last night.
00:56:08:90&00:56:10:82#Yeah, you kind of disappeared.
00:56:11:57&00:56:13:74#Yeah, I do that.
00:56:15:28&00:56:18:83#Listen, I know I can be
hard to be around sometimes.
00:56:19:33&00:56:21:50#I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.
00:56:21:58&00:56:23:62#No, no,
I want to hang.
00:56:24:04&00:56:25:84#You know, the whole
evil ex-boyfriend thing...
00:56:25:92&00:56:26:92#Exes.
00:56:27:00&00:56:28:00#It's no biggie.
00:56:28:63&00:56:31:17#I know it's early,
00:56:31:26&00:56:33:72#but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...
00:56:33:80&00:56:34:93#Shit!
00:56:36:26&00:56:37:39#It's my ex.
00:56:37:47&00:56:38:72#A big one?
Mmm-hmm.
00:56:39:52&00:56:40:85#Envy.
00:56:43:60&00:56:44:77#I'm gonna...
00:56:46:07&00:56:47:44#Excuse me.
00:56:49:94&00:56:51:03#Your hair is getting shaggy.
00:56:51:11&00:56:52:11#Yeah?
00:56:52:20&00:56:53:74#So, that's Ramona.
00:56:53:82&00:56:54:86#Yeah.
00:56:55:12&00:56:56:53#Okay, I'm jealous.
00:56:56:62&00:56:57:66#You're jealous?
00:56:57:91&00:56:58:95#I'm allowed.
00:56:59:16&00:57:01:37#You left me for that cocky pretty boy.
00:57:01:46&00:57:03:12#You haven't even seen him.
00:57:03:33&00:57:05:54#I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.
00:57:05:63&00:57:08:42#Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.
00:57:08:50&00:57:11:34#You should so totally come.
00:57:11:42&00:57:13:93#That's so not going to happen.
00:57:14:01&00:57:15:93#Great, you're so on the list.
00:57:17:85&00:57:21:22#Caramel macchiato for Pilgrim.
00:57:21:93&00:57:23:35#So, that was Envy.
00:57:24:60&00:57:26:06#What happened with the two of you?
00:57:26:15&00:57:28:06#Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?
00:57:28:15&00:57:29:65#She wanted to move to Montreal,
00:57:29:73&00:57:31:15#because she missed her best friend.
00:57:31:61&00:57:33:03#This guy, Todd.
00:57:33:11&00:57:35:07#And two weeks later,
they were sleeping together, I guess?
00:57:35:16&00:57:36:74#Basically.
00:57:36:82&00:57:39:99#Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.
00:57:40:08&00:57:43:83#I can see how it sucks.
Having the past come back to haunt you.
00:57:44:16&00:57:46:58#Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?
00:57:46:67&00:57:48:21#What do you want to think about?
00:57:48:50&00:57:50:59#How warm my place is right now.
00:57:50:67&00:57:51:67#Oh.
00:57:53:09&00:57:55:84#And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?
00:57:56:18&00:57:58:68#I couldn't stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.
00:57:58:76&00:58:00:22#Is that the Uma Thurman movie?
00:58:00:31&00:58:04:60#Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.
00:58:04:69&00:58:06:77#Double negative.
It's tricky.
00:58:06:85&00:58:08:73#It's over. Move on.
00:58:08:81&00:58:09:77#Word.
00:58:09:86&00:58:12:57#Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.
00:58:12:86&00:58:14:94#From this moment on,
00:58:15:03&00:58:17:78#I will think of Envy Adams no more!
00:58:19:20&00:58:20:37#I have distressing news.
00:58:20:45&00:58:23:41#Is it news that we suck, because I
really don't think I can take it.
00:58:23:50&00:58:26:50#No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night
00:58:26:58&00:58:28:67#and Envy asked us to open for them.
00:58:28:75&00:58:29:79#I hate you.
00:58:29:88&00:58:32:04#A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.
00:58:32:13&00:58:33:50#Maybe you can put your history aside
00:58:33:59&00:58:35:42#until we get through
this thing, for the band.
00:58:35:76&00:58:37:47#For the band?
For the band?
00:58:37:55&00:58:38:93#Can't we do our...
For the band?
00:58:39:01&00:58:40:14#Can't we do our own secret shows?
00:58:40:22&00:58:41:93#All our shows are secret shows.
00:58:42:22&00:58:45:14#We're doing it.
G-Man might be there.
00:58:45:23&00:58:47:14#We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.
00:58:47:23&00:58:50:56#We have to get some buzz going.
We need groundswell.
00:58:50:65&00:58:52:19#We need stalkers.
00:58:59:49&00:59:01:07#What would you do if
your ex was in a band
00:59:01:16&00:59:02:87#and they wanted you to open for them?
00:59:03:08&00:59:04:74#If my ex was in a band?
00:59:04:83&00:59:05:83#Mmm-hmm.
00:59:06:41&00:59:07:91#Might be a little
awkward, but maybe
00:59:08:00&00:59:09:67#it's the grown-up thing to do.
00:59:09:96&00:59:12:59#Yeah. We're all
adults here, right?
00:59:14:21&00:59:15:88#Oh, my God!
00:59:15:96&00:59:17:97#He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick!
00:59:18:05&00:59:19:59#I hate her stupid guts!
00:59:19:93&00:59:24:89#He only likes her because she's old.
She's probably, like, 25!
00:59:25:22&00:59:27:56#She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?
00:59:27:64&00:59:29:56#I think you mentioned she was fat.
00:59:29:65&00:59:30:98#She's got a head start.
00:59:31:06&00:59:34:44#I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!
00:59:34:52&00:59:35:57#Hey, this really burns.
00:59:35:65&00:59:36:69#You should rinse.
00:59:37:86&00:59:40:40#When I got this idea,
I just thought, "I have to do it!"
00:59:40:49&00:59:42:32#I can't hear anything you're saying.
00:59:43:12&00:59:45:28#Oh, God! I look so
00:59:47:00&00:59:48:62#good.
00:59:49:21&00:59:51:58#Ramona Flowers stole my Scott.
00:59:51:92&00:59:54:71#But I know how to get him back.
00:59:55:21&00:59:56:25#How?
01:00:07:89&01:00:10:02#Come on,
come on
01:00:14:61&01:00:16:90#Thank you,
we were Sex Bob-Omb.
01:00:16:98&01:00:18:44#Yeah!
01:00:18:53&01:00:20:74#We have some merch at the back, so...
01:00:22:16&01:00:23:82#Okay, bar? Now?
01:00:28:45&01:00:30:75#Level with me.
Did we suck?
01:00:30:83&01:00:32:96#I don't know.
Did you?
01:00:34:71&01:00:37:38#She has to go.
She knows we suck.
01:00:41:68&01:00:43:01#Hey, Ramona.
01:00:45:05&01:00:46:30#Hey.
01:00:47:64&01:00:49:27#What the hell?
01:00:58:23&01:00:59:57#Hey.
01:00:59:65&01:01:01:03#Hey, Scott.
01:01:01:11&01:01:03:24#What the hell?
01:01:03:32&01:01:05:07#Look who Knives is hanging out with.
01:01:05:70&01:01:06:87#Who is that girl again?
01:01:06:95&01:01:07:95#Scott dated her.
01:01:08:04&01:01:09:08#Briefly, briefly.
01:01:09:54&01:01:10:79#How old is she?
01:01:15:29&01:01:16:50#I gotta pee on her.
01:01:16:59&01:01:19:46#I mean, I gotta pee.
Pee time.
01:01:20:96&01:01:24:38#And then it was time
01:01:24:47&01:01:28:14#for Toronto to drown in the sweet sorrow
01:01:28:22&01:01:32:89#of The Clash at Demonhead!
01:01:36:23&01:01:38:56#Envy! Envy!
01:01:40:94&01:01:42:32#That guy on bass...
01:01:42:40&01:01:43:65#Oh, yeah
01:01:43:74&01:01:45:03#...that's Todd.
01:01:45:11&01:01:46:20#I know.
01:01:46:28&01:01:47:78#Oh, yeah?
01:01:48:78&01:01:49:99#You know?
01:01:50:08&01:01:52:29#Oh, yeah!
01:01:52:91&01:01:54:58#Oh, no.
01:01:54:92&01:01:58:63#Hello, again,
friend of a friend
01:01:58:71&01:02:00:54#I knew you well
01:02:02:59&01:02:04:51#Our common goal
01:02:04:59&01:02:09:10#was waiting for the world to end
01:02:10:35&01:02:12:26#Now that the truth
01:02:12:35&01:02:16:89#is just a rule that you demand
01:02:18:06&01:02:19:86#You crack the whip
01:02:19:94&01:02:24:19#Shape-shift and trick the past again
01:02:24:28&01:02:28:57#Send you my love on the wire
01:02:28:66&01:02:31:99#Lift you up,
every time
01:02:32:08&01:02:34:75#Everyone
01:02:35:96&01:02:37:83#pulls away
01:02:39:42&01:02:42:63#from you
01:02:43:13&01:02:45:42#That was...
That was devastating.
01:02:45:51&01:02:47:47#Oh, my God.
Just, oh, my God.
01:02:47:55&01:02:50:55#Yeah, you should see them live.
They're much better live.
01:02:50:64&01:02:51:89#I think I'm gonna throw up.
01:02:54:27&01:02:55:81#I can't even believe I'm saying this,
01:02:55:89&01:02:58:64#but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.
01:02:58:73&01:03:00:10#All of us?
01:03:00:23&01:03:01:65#Did I stutter?
01:03:05:40&01:03:07:40#Wait, how do you know Envy?
01:03:07:49&01:03:08:57#Scott dated her.
01:03:13:66&01:03:14:95#Hey, Ramona.
01:03:15:79&01:03:17:04#Hey, Todd.
01:03:17:50&01:03:19:08#It's been awhile.
01:03:19:54&01:03:20:54#Mmm-hmm.
01:03:21:04&01:03:22:04#Mmm-hmm?
01:03:22:88&01:03:24:17#I think we should get out of here.
01:03:24:25&01:03:26:21#So, how was the tour?
You guys play with the Pixies?
01:03:26:30&01:03:27:80#You're like a superstar now.
01:03:27:88&01:03:30:59#Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.
01:03:30:68&01:03:31:68#Um, Envy...
01:03:32:93&01:03:34:39#I read your blog.
01:03:34:76&01:03:37:77#So, Scott and Ramona, eh?
01:03:37:85&01:03:38:93#What of it?
01:03:39:02&01:03:40:10#You guys make a cute couple,
you know?
01:03:41:35&01:03:42:48#Suit each other.
01:03:42:56&01:03:44:82#You're my role model, Envy.
01:03:44:90&01:03:47:11#Ramona, I like your outfit.
Affordable?
01:03:47:19&01:03:49:20#Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?
01:03:49:28&01:03:51:49#I'm talking to Ramona right now.
01:03:51:95&01:03:52:99#Ramona lived in New York.
01:03:53:12&01:03:54:16#Did she?
01:03:54:37&01:03:57:62#I was just there.
Played the Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.
01:03:58:12&01:03:59:21#You know him, right?
01:04:00:58&01:04:02:29#I've kissed the lips that kissed you!
01:04:07:09&01:04:08:34#Knives!
01:04:09:22&01:04:10:30#What?
01:04:10:38&01:04:11:55#I'm not afraid to hit a girl.
01:04:13:47&01:04:15:01#I'm a rock star.
01:04:15:10&01:04:16:26#Oh, my God!
01:04:17:31&01:04:19:64#You punched the highlights
out of her hair.
01:04:21:35&01:04:23:90#He punched the highlights
out of her hair!
01:04:24:15&01:04:26:02#You are incorrigible.
01:04:26:23&01:04:28:19#I don't know the meaning of the word.
01:04:30:15&01:04:34:91#So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?
01:04:35:45&01:04:37:83#Fun? In Toronto?
01:04:38:45&01:04:41:16#That's it!
You cocky cock!
01:04:41:62&01:04:43:87#You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.
01:04:55:76&01:04:57:43#My neck.
01:04:58:72&01:04:59:81#Your hair.
01:05:00:89&01:05:02:27#Didn't you know?
01:05:02:48&01:05:03:73#Todd's vegan.
01:05:09:48&01:05:10:48#Vegan?
01:05:12:03&01:05:13:86#It's not really that big of a deal.
01:05:15:57&01:05:16:91#No kidding.
01:05:18:91&01:05:20:41#Anyone can be vegan.
01:05:21:25&01:05:23:33#Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.
01:05:23:54&01:05:24:62#Ovo-what?
01:05:25:25&01:05:29:46#I partake not in the meat,
nor the breast milk, nor the ovum
01:05:29:55&01:05:31:63#of any creature with a face.
01:05:31:72&01:05:32:88#Short answer,
01:05:32:97&01:05:35:47#being vegan just makes you
better than most people.
01:05:35:55&01:05:36:64#Bingo.
01:05:40:10&01:05:41:56#Hey, man, question.
01:05:41:98&01:05:44:39#I always wondered,
how does not eating dairy products
01:05:44:48&01:05:46:31#give you psychic powers?
01:05:46:40&01:05:47:90#Okay.
01:05:47:98&01:05:50:36#You know how you only
use 10% of your brain?
01:05:50:44&01:05:52:74#That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.
01:05:52:82&01:05:54:90#Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?
01:05:54:99&01:05:56:41#Go ahead and get snippy, baby.
01:05:56:49&01:05:58:95#If you knew the science, maybe I'd
listen to a word you're saying.
01:06:03:79&01:06:06:54#If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?
01:06:06:63&01:06:07:67#It's not raining.
01:06:07:75&01:06:08:75#Oh.
01:06:09:00&01:06:10:63#Then why don't you
give me the Cliff Notes
01:06:10:71&01:06:13:34#on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.
01:06:13:42&01:06:14:76#Is that really important right now?
01:06:14:84&01:06:16:76#Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory
01:06:16:84&01:06:20:14#that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.
01:06:21:97&01:06:25:23#I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.
01:06:25:89&01:06:29:52#Guess that's not very nice,
but I used to be, kind of like that.
01:06:30:27&01:06:33:61#We hated everyone.
We wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.
01:06:33:69&01:06:35:86#He punched a hole in the moon for me.
01:06:35:95&01:06:37:78#It was pretty crazy.
01:06:37:86&01:06:39:07#A week and a half later he told me
01:06:39:16&01:06:40:95#his dad was sending
him to Vegan Academy,
01:06:41:70&01:06:43:04#so I dumped him.
01:06:43:66&01:06:45:91#Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?
01:06:46:00&01:06:47:83#You've never been the dumpee?
01:06:47:92&01:06:51:04#Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch.
01:06:51:13&01:06:52:92#It's part of the reason I moved here.
01:06:53:00&01:06:56:30#I was really hoping to just
leave it all behind me.
01:06:56:38&01:06:57:76#Hey, lovebirds...
01:06:58:76&01:07:01:05#We have unfinished business,
I and he.
01:07:01:72&01:07:02:97#He and me.
01:07:03:06&01:07:04:52#Don't you talk to me about grammar.
01:07:04:60&01:07:06:48#I dislike you, capisce?
01:07:06:56&01:07:08:31#Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.
01:07:08:40&01:07:09:48#What?
01:07:09:56&01:07:11:06#Because you'll be dust by Monday.
01:07:11:73&01:07:12:77#Um...
01:07:12:86&01:07:14:90#Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.
01:07:14:98&01:07:18:24#And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.
01:07:18:86&01:07:20:41#She dusts.
01:07:22:58&01:07:23:99#So, what's on Monday?
01:07:25:04&01:07:29:16#Because it's Friday now.
She has the weekends off, so...
01:07:29:75&01:07:31:71#Monday. Right?
01:07:32:38&01:07:33:71#Basically, you can't win this fight.
01:07:33:80&01:07:34:96#You're gonna have to give up this girl,
01:07:35:05&01:07:36:38#because Todd's gonna kill you.
01:07:37:26&01:07:38:67#You used to be so nice!
01:07:50:94&01:07:53:94#Scott, we're gonna go to
Pizza Pizza for a slice.
01:07:54:02&01:07:55:44#Call us when you're done.
01:07:55:53&01:07:58:11#He'll be done.
Real soon.
01:08:01:53&01:08:04:78#Sounds like someone wants to get funky.
01:09:27:91&01:09:32:04#I can read your thoughts.
Your will is broken. You're through.
01:09:32:54&01:09:34:37#What say we drink to my memory?
01:09:34:54&01:09:36:42#Fair trade blend with soy milk?
01:09:37:00&01:09:38:92#I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.
01:09:39:00&01:09:41:00#Dude, I can see in your mind's eye.
01:09:41:09&01:09:43:22#You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees
01:09:43:30&01:09:45:51#in an attempt to make
me break vegan edge.
01:09:45:59&01:09:47:39#I'll take the one with soy.
01:09:50:22&01:09:52:06#Thanks, tool.
01:09:53:39&01:09:56:65#Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.
01:09:56:73&01:09:59:52#But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.
01:09:59:61&01:10:02:53#You know,
in my mind's eye or whatever.
01:10:03:57&01:10:05:07#What are you talking about?
01:10:05:15&01:10:06:57#You just drank half-and-half, baby.
01:10:08:41&01:10:09:70#Freeze!
Vegan police!
01:10:09:78&01:10:10:99#Vegan police!
01:10:11:08&01:10:14:58#Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,
01:10:14:66&01:10:17:92#code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.
01:10:18:46&01:10:19:54#That's bullroar!
01:10:19:63&01:10:21:55#No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!
01:10:21:63&01:10:23:80#But it's only my first offense.
01:10:23:88&01:10:25:01#Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...
01:10:25:09&01:10:26:47#Take it.
01:10:27:39&01:10:30:01#At 12:27 a.m. on February 1 st,
01:10:30:10&01:10:31:39#you knowingly ingested gelato.
01:10:32:27&01:10:33:35#Gelato isn't vegan?
01:10:33:43&01:10:34:85#It's milk and eggs, bitch.
01:10:34:93&01:10:38:06#On April 4th, 7:30 p.m.,
you partook a plate of chicken parmesan.
01:10:39:73&01:10:40:94#Chicken isn't vegan?
01:10:41:61&01:10:43:65#The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.
01:10:59:79&01:11:01:25#Oh, my God!
01:11:01:34&01:11:03:88#No. No.
01:11:04:96&01:11:07:34#You once were a vegone,
01:11:07:43&01:11:09:64#but now you will be gone.
01:11:09:80&01:11:10:97#Vegone?
01:11:25:90&01:11:28:07#Yeah!
Yeah!
01:11:33:99&01:11:35:99#Sorry, I guess.
01:11:37:21&01:11:39:00#Sorry?
01:11:39:29&01:11:42:54#You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.
01:11:43:63&01:11:47:21#You kicked my heart in the ass,
so I guess we're even.
01:11:48:68&01:11:50:18#Natalie.
01:11:51:14&01:11:55:35#Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.
01:11:57:06&01:11:58:18#Maybe they should.
01:12:01:19&01:12:02:90#Let's get out of here.
01:12:10:45&01:12:13:37#For the record,
I am so pissed off for you, right now.
01:12:13:45&01:12:15:28#Shut the up, Julie.
01:12:15:37&01:12:16:66#Okay.
01:12:17:83&01:12:19:50#We're still going to
the after-party, right?
01:12:19:58&01:12:21:37#I'm not sure there's going
to be much of a party.
01:12:21:46&01:12:23:13#I think a third of the
band just went "poom."
01:12:23:21&01:12:25:84#Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.
01:12:25:92&01:12:28:67#Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.
01:12:28:76&01:12:30:72#Then why would we... Oh.
01:12:30:80&01:12:32:88#Neil, you down?
01:12:32:97&01:12:34:26#Scott, you're in, right?
01:12:35:26&01:12:36:39#You wanna go?
01:12:36:47&01:12:39:77#Well, I kind of almost died back there.
01:12:39:85&01:12:40:89#I'm not saying I want to go.
01:12:41:06&01:12:42:10#Yeah.
We can totally go.
01:12:42:19&01:12:43:19#I'll do whatever you want to do.
01:12:43:27&01:12:44:27#So, let's go.
01:12:45:52&01:12:47:23#We really don't have
to go to this thing.
01:12:47:32&01:12:49:11#It'll probably be a
bad scene all around.
01:12:49:19&01:12:51:53#No, I'm fine.
It's just...
01:12:51:78&01:12:53:24#It's just... Well...
01:12:54:45&01:12:57:49#Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?
01:12:57:58&01:12:59:33#So far,
you're not a total ass.
01:12:59:41&01:13:00:58#But I'm part ass?
01:13:00:66&01:13:02:79#If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.
01:13:02:87&01:13:03:87#Wait, is that good?
01:13:03:96&01:13:05:13#It's what I need right now.
01:13:05:21&01:13:06:21#But not later?
01:13:06:29&01:13:08:13#Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?
01:13:08:21&01:13:10:92#I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.
01:13:11:01&01:13:12:59#I'd just like to live.
01:13:13:05&01:13:14:51#Look, I know Todd was bad news,
01:13:14:59&01:13:16:01#but are you saying Envy wasn't?
01:13:16:10&01:13:17:43#We all have baggage.
01:13:17:51&01:13:20:56#Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.
01:13:20:64&01:13:22:52#What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?
01:13:22:60&01:13:23:89#Exes.
Whatever.
01:13:23:98&01:13:26:15#No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.
01:13:26:23&01:13:28:77#What about you and that girl, Knives?
Who broke up with who?
01:13:28:86&01:13:31:44#I believe I broke up with her.
01:13:31:53&01:13:32:82#And was she cool with that?
01:13:32:90&01:13:35:36#Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.
01:13:35:45&01:13:36:45#You sure about that?
01:13:36:53&01:13:38:08#Yeah, she's very mature for her age.
01:13:38:16&01:13:39:41#We had a very healthy breakup.
01:13:39:49&01:13:40:70#We're all peaches and gravy.
01:13:40:83&01:13:42:08#No!
01:13:42:25&01:13:43:71#What about you and Kim?
01:13:43:79&01:13:45:96#Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.
01:13:46:04&01:13:48:04#It was high school.
She had freckles.
01:13:48:25&01:13:49:29#That's it?
01:13:49:38&01:13:52:38#Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.
01:13:52:47&01:13:53:55#That's really the whole story?
01:13:53:63&01:13:55:51#Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?
01:13:55:59&01:13:58:22#I fought a crazy, 80-foot-tall,
purple-suited dude
01:13:58:30&01:14:00:39#and I had to fight 96
guys to get to him.
01:14:00:47&01:14:03:10#He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?
01:14:03:18&01:14:05:60#And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.
01:14:05:69&01:14:08:11#Does that make you feel any better?
01:14:08:19&01:14:10:98#Well, now you are being a total ass.
Welcome to the club.
01:14:11:82&01:14:14:03#I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.
01:14:14:11&01:14:17:66#Hey, don't worry.
I don't even know what I'm like anymore.
01:14:18:53&01:14:21:33#I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.
01:14:21:41&01:14:22:79#Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?
01:14:30:38&01:14:32:00#The girl from earlier?
01:14:32:67&01:14:34:59#Roxy?
You know this girl?
01:14:34:67&01:14:37:68#Boy, does she know me.
01:14:37:89&01:14:40:10#What is she talking about?
01:14:40:30&01:14:41:89#He really doesn't know?
01:14:43:31&01:14:44:35#Wait.
01:14:45:23&01:14:46:23#Hmm?
01:14:49:15&01:14:51:11#You and her?
It was just a phase.
01:14:51:19&01:14:52:82#Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?
01:14:52:90&01:14:54:40#It meant nothing.
I didn't think it would count.
01:14:54:49&01:14:55:53#It meant nothing?
01:14:55:61&01:14:56:82#I was just a little bi-curious.
01:14:56:90&01:14:58:45#Well, honey,
01:14:58:53&01:15:01:41#I'm a little bi-furious.
01:15:13:09&01:15:15:17#Do that again and I will end you.
01:15:15:26&01:15:16:72#Back off, hasbian.
01:15:17:22&01:15:19:72#If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.
01:15:21:43&01:15:23:47#The League has spoken.
01:15:24:39&01:15:26:64#Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here
01:15:26:73&01:15:29:39#because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.
01:15:43:74&01:15:44:99#Wallace?
Uh-huh?
01:15:45:70&01:15:47:29#This is happening, right?
Oh, yeah.
01:15:47:50&01:15:49:00#Kick her in the balls.
01:16:11:69&01:16:12:90#I'm sending you back to Gideon
01:16:12:98&01:16:14:73#in a thousand pieces,
you slag!
01:16:17:19&01:16:18:19#Ha!
01:16:23:82&01:16:25:37#I'd rather be dead than go back.
01:16:25:45&01:16:26:79#He's a creep,
you're a bitch,
01:16:26:87&01:16:28:04#and you all deserve each other.
01:16:28:12&01:16:30:29#Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.
01:16:30:37&01:16:31:46#Meaning?
01:16:31:54&01:16:35:13#Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.
01:16:37:30&01:16:40:51#I don't think I can hit a girl.
They're soft.
01:16:40:59&01:16:41:72#You don't have a choice.
01:17:01:07&01:17:02:99#Fight your own battles,
lazy ass!
01:17:09:58&01:17:10:70#Lazy ass!
01:17:17:67&01:17:19:67#Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.
01:17:20:38&01:17:21:67#Some sooner than others.
01:17:24:34&01:17:28:68#Your BF's about to get F'd in the B.
01:17:29:18&01:17:31:81#Her weak point is the back of her knees.
01:17:31:89&01:17:33:60#Wait, how does that work?
01:17:33:81&01:17:36:27#Whenever we were making
out I would just...
01:17:36:36&01:17:37:81#Okay, enough.
01:17:46:20&01:17:51:75#You'll never be able to do this to her.
01:18:05:72&01:18:06:89#So...
01:18:06:97&01:18:08:39#Two gin-and-tonics, please?
01:18:08:47&01:18:09:64#I thought you didn't drink.
01:18:09:72&01:18:12:56#Only on special occasions.
Why? Did you want one?
01:18:13:23&01:18:15:60#Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?
01:18:15:69&01:18:18:65#Maybe you could just give me
a list of all of your exes
01:18:18:73&01:18:20:36#so that I can at least
know who's going to
01:18:20:44&01:18:22:03#beat my ass into the ground next.
01:18:22:11&01:18:24:78#Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.
01:18:24:86&01:18:26:32#Maybe we could exchange our information.
01:18:26:41&01:18:28:78#Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern
01:18:28:87&01:18:30:12#for my mortal well-being,
01:18:30:20&01:18:33:24#is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?
01:18:37:96&01:18:39:67#I think we should split.
01:18:39:75&01:18:42:17#As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?
01:18:42:25&01:18:43:71#I'd hope you could figure that out.
01:18:43:80&01:18:45:76#Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?
01:18:45:84&01:18:48:55#How could I? I feel like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.
01:18:48:64&01:18:49:89#Dirty laundry.
You're drunk.
01:18:50:22&01:18:51:22#I had, like,
one drink.
01:18:51:31&01:18:55:02#I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.
01:18:55:10&01:18:56:10#I thought you might be
more understanding.
01:18:56:27&01:18:57:35#I just...
01:18:57:44&01:18:59:94#You're just another evil
ex waiting to happen.
01:19:02:65&01:19:04:57#That was harsh.
01:19:05:95&01:19:07:90#That was not good.
01:19:09:49&01:19:11:12#That was embarrassing.
01:19:12:28&01:19:13:49#One more.
01:19:13:58&01:19:15:58#P.S. Here's your stupid list.
01:19:17:25&01:19:20:21#Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.
01:19:20:29&01:19:23:00#Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?
01:19:25:46&01:19:26:80#You don't know?
01:19:27:09&01:19:28:22#The Katayanagi Twins
01:19:28:30&01:19:30:72#just happen to be the
next band in the battle.
01:19:31:30&01:19:34:51#They are totally bad-ass.
01:19:34:60&01:19:36:56#Ramona dated twins?
Apparently.
01:19:36:64&01:19:37:73#At the same time?
01:19:37:81&01:19:38:81#You know what?
01:19:38:89&01:19:40:23#I don't know and I don't want to know.
01:19:40:31&01:19:43:06#Good. Because you know how I feel
about girls blocking the rock.
01:19:43:15&01:19:44:73#Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.
01:19:44:82&01:19:45:94#If it's gonna be an issue though,
01:19:46:03&01:19:47:07#Young Neil can fill in for you.
01:19:47:15&01:19:48:49#It's not an issue.
You know bands,
01:19:48:57&01:19:49:99#I know battles.
We got it covered.
01:19:50:20&01:19:51:99#But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.
01:19:52:07&01:19:53:37#Not only do I want to take part
01:19:53:45&01:19:55:24#I want to take them apart.
01:19:55:66&01:19:57:70#Okay, I'm getting tingles.
01:19:57:79&01:19:58:87#Whoa!
01:20:00:58&01:20:02:42#Okay, we're doomed.
Oh!
01:20:02:50&01:20:04:79#That poster needs more
exclamation marks.
01:20:05:38&01:20:06:84#Oh, man,
we're gonna get killed.
01:20:06:92&01:20:08:51#Come on, we're going
on in five minutes.
01:20:09:01&01:20:10:97#Wait, aren't the
Katayanagis going on first?
01:20:11:05&01:20:13:51#I think you're both on first.
01:20:13:80&01:20:16:10#Wait, "Amp versus amp"?
01:20:16:18&01:20:17:81#We're going on stage at the same time?
01:20:17:89&01:20:19:23#That's impossible.
01:20:20:73&01:20:21:98#Okay, my bad.
01:20:22:06&01:20:24:11#Your bad is
saying, "My bad."
01:20:24:52&01:20:28:11#We shouldn't even be here.
We shouldn't even be here!
01:20:28:19&01:20:30:53#Come on, man!
I put my problems aside for the music.
01:20:30:61&01:20:31:95#If I can do that,
we can do anything.
01:20:32:03&01:20:33:57#Did you speak to Ramona, then?
01:20:33:66&01:20:36:53#What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.
01:20:36:62&01:20:37:62#Oh.
01:20:37:70&01:20:39:00#She's totally here.
01:20:41:92&01:20:43:04#Scott?
01:20:44:04&01:20:45:42#Not that I care,
01:20:45:50&01:20:47:55#but you should go talk
to her before she's gone.
01:20:48:13&01:20:49:13#Thanks, Kim.
01:20:49:22&01:20:50:34#And I really don't care.
01:20:52:22&01:20:53:68#I didn't mean to put
you through all that.
01:20:53:76&01:20:56:30#I only did it because I love you.
You know that.
01:21:33:80&01:21:35:59#Okay, gang,
can we do this?
01:21:36:22&01:21:37:43#I mean,
we can do this, right?
01:21:37:51&01:21:38:60#Right.
01:21:38:68&01:21:39:93#Scott?
01:21:41:85&01:21:42:93#Scott!
01:22:00:66&01:22:02:45#They tore the roof off!
01:22:06:54&01:22:07:79#We are Sex Bob-Omb
01:22:07:88&01:22:10:84#and we're here to make you think
about death and get sad and stuff!
01:22:13:51&01:22:15:59#This is the beginning of the song.
01:22:16:51&01:22:19:22#I'm hearing voices,
animal noises
01:22:19:31&01:22:20:64#The crГЁme de la crГЁme
01:22:20:72&01:22:22:22#The feminine abyss
01:22:22:31&01:22:25:81#And reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind
01:22:27:90&01:22:29:31#My body's stupid
01:22:29:40&01:22:30:73#Stereo putrid
01:22:30:82&01:22:32:36#Spilling out music
01:22:32:44&01:22:33:78#Into raw sewage
01:22:33:86&01:22:37:03#Reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind
01:22:42:45&01:22:47:87#My threshold
01:22:48:21&01:22:50:08#Reaching
01:22:50:92&01:22:53:76#My threshold
01:23:04:85&01:23:07:89#Let's just break up now
and get it over with.
01:23:07:98&01:23:11:48#We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!
01:23:11:57&01:23:13:48#Gideon's here?
Where?
01:23:13:57&01:23:15:69#That geeky guy next to your girlfriend.
01:23:17:86&01:23:19:41#That's Gideon?
01:23:19:49&01:23:21:70#Gideon is G-Man?
01:23:22:12&01:23:24:04#All right,
let's do this.
01:23:26:50&01:23:28:96#Reaching my threshold
01:23:29:04&01:23:37:51#My threshold
01:24:23:55&01:24:24:72#We're out.
01:24:29:39&01:24:30:64#What are you doing?
01:24:30:73&01:24:31:94#Getting a life.
01:24:45:62&01:24:47:99#I just came to see your show.
01:24:51:12&01:24:52:37#I have to...
01:25:00:30&01:25:01:88#Ramona.
01:25:02:63&01:25:05:51#Ramona, I need to tell you something.
01:25:05:60&01:25:06:89#Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.
01:25:06:97&01:25:09:02#Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof
01:25:09:10&01:25:10:52#just to avoid getting hurt.
01:25:10:60&01:25:14:69#I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.
01:25:14:77&01:25:18:40#I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff
01:25:18:48&01:25:20:40#because I'm in lesbians with you.
01:25:20:86&01:25:21:90#What?
01:25:21:99&01:25:23:32#I really,
really mean it.
01:25:25:70&01:25:27:33#Oh! Okay.
01:25:27:41&01:25:28:95#It's your turn.
What did you want to tell me?
01:25:30:75&01:25:32:29#That we have to break up.
01:25:33:37&01:25:34:54#What?
01:25:34:63&01:25:36:08#It's Gideon.
01:25:36:96&01:25:38:59#I just can't...
01:25:41:01&01:25:42:42#I can't help myself around him.
01:25:42:51&01:25:44:38#That's the bad news.
01:25:45:18&01:25:46:43#Hey.
01:25:46:51&01:25:49:89#The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.
01:25:49:97&01:25:51:56#Bob-Omb.
Three-piece rock outfit
01:25:51:64&01:25:54:02#with a smoking hot red-head on drums.
01:25:54:10&01:25:55:94#Music to my ear-holes.
01:25:57:06&01:25:58:98#You know what?
I'm not even going to wait
01:25:59:07&01:26:00:53#to see how you guys do in the final.
01:26:00:61&01:26:03:03#I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.
01:26:03:70&01:26:06:57#See? I'm not such
a bad guy after all.
01:26:07:32&01:26:09:95#You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.
01:26:10:04&01:26:13:37#No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.
01:26:13:87&01:26:15:58#Ow! Scott.
01:26:16:08&01:26:18:75#You got to try and keep
your emotions in check, man.
01:26:18:84&01:26:21:50#Don't let what's past ruin your future.
01:26:21:59&01:26:23:17#The people need to hear us, Scott.
01:26:23:26&01:26:25:84#Then you're gonna have to find
someone else to play bass.
01:26:27:68&01:26:28:68#Whoops.
01:26:29:72&01:26:33:47#Sign, sign, sign,
and we are all set.
01:26:33:89&01:26:35:98#Sweetie, shall we?
01:26:42:73&01:26:44:65#Oh! Scott.
01:26:45:24&01:26:47:49#You know,
we really should be thanking each other.
01:26:47:57&01:26:50:28#I mean, if it wasn't for me,
Ramona would never have been with you
01:26:50:37&01:26:52:37#but if it wasn't for you she
wouldn't have gotten back with me,
01:26:52:45&01:26:54:33#so I guess it all shakes out.
01:26:55:79&01:26:57:62#Scotty, buddy,
01:26:59:96&01:27:03:71#between you and I,
the whole League of Evil Exes thing?
01:27:04:38&01:27:07:68#I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...
01:27:08:64&01:27:09:93#Forgiven?
01:27:10:39&01:27:12:22#All right, let's go.
01:27:12:93&01:27:14:14#Yes!
01:27:14:93&01:27:18:02#This is it, guys.
We are on our way.
01:27:21:73&01:27:23:44#I said "lesbians."
01:27:51:85&01:27:53:43#Scott.
01:27:54:47&01:27:55:81#Was she really the one?
01:27:56:60&01:27:57:73#The what?
01:27:57:81&01:28:00:14#I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?
01:28:01:27&01:28:04:65#Like, with jetpacks.
01:28:11:07&01:28:13:62#Time heals all wounds,
little brother.
01:28:13:70&01:28:18:16#Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends.
01:28:18:50&01:28:19:50#Seven.
01:28:19:67&01:28:20:71#That's not that bad.
01:28:23:00&01:28:24:75#Hey. Yeah, I know.
01:28:24:96&01:28:27:34#It's so pathetic!
01:28:30:01&01:28:31:93#Turn off the light!
01:28:35:01&01:28:37:72#Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk
01:28:38:06&01:28:39:27#and I apologize for that.
01:28:39:35&01:28:40:39#Okay.
01:28:40:48&01:28:42:19#And he apologizes, too.
01:28:42:27&01:28:43:35#Sorry.
01:28:44:73&01:28:47:65#Scott, you know I love you.
01:28:48:32&01:28:50:32#But I'm gonna need my own bed tonight.
01:28:50:86&01:28:52:53#It's for sex.
01:28:53:03&01:28:54:24#Right.
01:28:54:99&01:28:58:04#I may need it for the
rest of the week, too.
01:28:58:37&01:28:59:58#Right.
01:28:59:66&01:29:00:75#And the year.
01:29:01:37&01:29:02:62#I get it.
01:29:02:71&01:29:04:42#Maybe you can move in with Ramona.
01:29:05:88&01:29:07:13#She's with Gideon.
01:29:07:21&01:29:08:46#Oh, man.
01:29:08:55&01:29:10:63#That's probably just because
he's better than you.
01:29:10:72&01:29:11:80#Mmm.
01:29:11:88&01:29:14:84#Either way,
this fight is over.
01:29:15:30&01:29:16:30#Mmm-hmm.
01:29:23:98&01:29:26:36#It's for Scott.
01:29:26:57&01:29:28:57#It's for you,
big guy.
01:29:30:65&01:29:31:65#Hello.
01:29:31:74&01:29:32:90#Hey, pal.
01:29:33:36&01:29:35:82#I just want to say I feel
terrible about earlier.
01:29:35:91&01:29:37:91#I don't want any hard feelings.
01:29:37:99&01:29:41:41#So I figured, why not be the bigger
man and just give you a call.
01:29:41:50&01:29:43:00#Is Ramona with you?
01:29:43:75&01:29:46:50#I don't know.
Are you with me?
01:29:48:09&01:29:49:13#Yeah.
01:29:50:63&01:29:53:26#Geez, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.
01:29:53:63&01:29:56:14#No, I just spilled hot
cocoa on my crotch.
01:29:56:22&01:29:57:30#Mmm-hmm.
01:29:57:39&01:29:58:76#Listen, as you know,
01:29:58:85&01:30:00:85#I'm opening a new Chaos
Theatre in Toronto.
01:30:00:93&01:30:03:18#And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.
01:30:03:27&01:30:06:10#It would feel really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.
01:30:06:19&01:30:09:98#They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!
01:30:10:07&01:30:11:40#Yeah?
Maybe I'll see you there.
01:30:11:53&01:30:12:86#I hope so, amigo.
01:30:13:20&01:30:15:61#I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.
01:30:15:70&01:30:16:74#What do you say?
01:30:16:82&01:30:17:87#Mmm.
01:30:17:95&01:30:19:20#Okay, laters.
01:30:19:79&01:30:21:29#What a perfect asshole.
01:30:23:79&01:30:26:67#Forget what I said earlier.
Finish him.
01:30:51:15&01:30:52:32#Password?
01:30:52:40&01:30:53:48#Whatever.
01:30:54:03&01:30:55:11#Cool.
01:30:59:49&01:31:00:87#Second password?
01:31:03:66&01:31:04:70#Cool.
01:31:08:92&01:31:11:42#We're not having no fun
We're not having no fun
01:31:11:50&01:31:14:96#No. The first album is much
better than the first album.
01:31:15:05&01:31:17:17#Fun
01:31:17:80&01:31:20:51#No fun
01:31:25:73&01:31:27:89#Scott! Let it go.
01:31:28:60&01:31:30:10#Don't give him the satisfaction.
01:31:30:19&01:31:32:31#What if I want the satisfaction?
01:31:32:40&01:31:33:73#Scott Pilgrim!
01:31:35:53&01:31:37:82#Buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre.
01:31:38:20&01:31:41:70#Somebody get this man a drink.
A Coke Zero, right?
01:31:47:25&01:31:48:96#I'm not here to drink.
01:31:49:17&01:31:51:33#Whoa, I've got no beef with you.
01:31:52:13&01:31:54:88#What if I have a beef with you?
01:31:55:21&01:31:58:05#Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?
01:31:58:34&01:31:59:47#You mean The League?
01:31:59:55&01:32:01:97#The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.
01:32:02:05&01:32:03:72#I'll show you how
ancient of history it is!
01:32:03:81&01:32:05:06#Wait, wait, wait!
01:32:05:56&01:32:08:23#There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.
01:32:08:31&01:32:12:94#The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.
01:32:13:02&01:32:14:98#Well, I ain't moving, buddy.
01:32:16:11&01:32:19:36#You wanna fight me for her?
01:32:19:45&01:32:25:08#Was that not clear?
01:32:25:16&01:32:26:24#I don't know.
01:32:26:33&01:32:31:50#Now, why on earth would
you want to do that?
01:32:31:92&01:32:33:58#Because I'm in love with her.
01:32:44:55&01:32:47:60#Aw! I think this
deserves a song.
01:32:47:68&01:32:48:93#Kimberly!
01:32:49:27&01:32:51:19#We are Sex Bob-Omb.
01:32:51:27&01:32:54:61#We are here to make money
and sell out and stuff.
01:32:54:69&01:32:55:90#One, two, three, four!
01:33:53:16&01:33:54:87#Your club sucks,
by the way.
01:33:54:96&01:33:59:55#Well, if my cathedral of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest
01:33:59:63&01:34:02:42#for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,
01:34:02:51&01:34:07:18#then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.
01:34:08:43&01:34:11:31#And a fast entrance into hell!
01:34:11:39&01:34:13:35#Scott!
01:34:17:56&01:34:19:02#Knives?
01:34:19:11&01:34:20:40#That's priceless.
01:34:20:48&01:34:22:32#You'll pay for what you did to him.
01:34:22:40&01:34:24:45#Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,
01:34:24:53&01:34:27:32#your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.
01:34:27:41&01:34:30:20#He was warned plenty of times,
but did he listen? No.
01:34:30:29&01:34:32:79#I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!
01:34:34:04&01:34:35:12#What?
01:34:35:21&01:34:36:92#You broke the heart that broke mine.
01:34:37:00&01:34:39:29#Get ready to Chau down!
01:34:44:55&01:34:45:76#You're kidding, right?
01:34:49:05&01:34:50:14#Wow!
01:34:50:22&01:34:53:35#I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?
01:34:53:43&01:34:54:85#That's incredible.
01:35:05:95&01:35:07:74#What the hell is your deal?
01:35:10:12&01:35:11:49#You stole him!
01:35:13:04&01:35:14:16#Stole him!
01:35:14:25&01:35:16:04#I don't know what you're talking about.
01:35:16:12&01:35:18:58#You liar! Liar!
01:35:18:88&01:35:22:25#I didn't steal your boyfriend!
I didn't steal Scott!
01:35:22:75&01:35:24:76#I didn't steal anyone!
01:35:32:51&01:35:34:93#You steal my boyfriend!
01:35:35:02&01:35:36:18#Wait! Wait!
01:35:36:27&01:35:39:23#Can we please stop all this fighting?
Nobody stole anybody.
01:35:39:31&01:35:42:15#Knives, I dated you and
then I dated Ramona, okay?
01:35:45:82&01:35:48:49#Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.
01:35:49:53&01:35:50:99#You cheated on me, Scott?
01:35:52:66&01:35:54:70#You cheated on both of us?
01:35:54:79&01:35:56:50#You cheated on me with Knives?
01:35:56:58&01:35:58:16#No,
01:35:59:46&01:36:02:00#I cheated on Knives with you.
01:36:02:46&01:36:03:59#Is there a difference?
01:36:04:34&01:36:05:55#You weren't wronged?
01:36:07:05&01:36:08:17#Right?
01:36:09:63&01:36:12:18#Game over.
01:36:17:10&01:36:18:31#Scotty,
01:36:18:81&01:36:21:81#you can cheat on these
ladies all you like.
01:36:22:23&01:36:25:07#But you can't cheat
01:36:26:32&01:36:27:44#death.
01:36:34:66&01:36:36:29#Oh, man.
01:36:36:49&01:36:40:54#Sorry.
Dying's got to suck.
01:36:40:92&01:36:44:25#You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.
01:36:45:55&01:36:47:13#Why him?
01:36:47:21&01:36:48:80#It's complicated.
01:36:48:88&01:36:51:01#Well, I'm not going anywhere,
01:36:52:34&01:36:54:34#so now might be a good
time to get into it.
01:36:55:68&01:36:59:56#Truth is, it was me
who was obsessed.
01:37:01:31&01:37:04:65#I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.
01:37:05:82&01:37:09:82#I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.
01:37:10:49&01:37:13:03#That's why I had to leave.
01:37:13:16&01:37:16:24#And that's when he
started paying attention.
01:37:16:53&01:37:17:95#So, why go back?
01:37:18:24&01:37:19:87#I can't help myself around him, Scott,
01:37:19:95&01:37:23:87#he just has this way of
getting into my head.
01:37:24:79&01:37:27:04#Well, that's legitimately disappointing.
01:37:27:38&01:37:29:25#I really will leave
you alone forever now.
01:37:29:34&01:37:31:88#No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.
01:37:33:38&01:37:35:39#That is evil.
01:37:37:06&01:37:40:27#I didn't mean for you to get
dragged into this, Scott.
01:37:40:89&01:37:43:31#I just wanted something simple.
01:37:44:73&01:37:46:81#I'm sorry it had to end this way.
01:37:47:44&01:37:49:40#Well, I really fought for you.
01:37:49:57&01:37:52:40#Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.
01:37:55:32&01:37:57:24#What? Wait.
01:37:58:08&01:38:02:00#But I feel like I learned something.
01:38:03:58&01:38:05:58#Which would be great if I wasn't dead.
01:38:09:42&01:38:11:00#So alone.
01:38:11:09&01:38:12:30#You're not alone.
01:38:15:09&01:38:16:18#Right!
01:38:26:06&01:38:27:31#Your hair looks stupid.
01:38:29:61&01:38:30:98#Second password?
01:38:34:86&01:38:35:95#Yeah, I saw it.
01:38:36:03&01:38:38:16#It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.
01:38:38:24&01:38:39:62#No fun
01:38:40:49&01:38:42:04#Scott! Let it go.
01:38:42:12&01:38:43:41#Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.
01:38:43:50&01:38:44:66#Stephen, the new lineup rocks.
01:38:44:75&01:38:46:12#You guys sound way better without me.
01:38:46:42&01:38:48:08#Young Neil,
you have learned well.
01:38:48:17&01:38:51:55#From this point forward you
will be known as "Neil."
01:38:51:88&01:38:53:01#And, Kim,
01:38:53:92&01:38:56:09#I'm sorry about everything.
01:38:57:34&01:38:58:80#I'm sorry about me.
01:39:00:14&01:39:02:35#Scott Pilgrim!
Hey, buddy!
01:39:02:43&01:39:05:89#Save it! You're pretentious!
This club sucks!
01:39:05:98&01:39:07:48#I've got beef.
Let's do it.
01:39:07:56&01:39:09:23#Wait, wait, wait!
01:39:10:65&01:39:14:28#You want to fight me for her?
01:39:14:36&01:39:15:65#No.
01:39:16:32&01:39:17:70#I want to fight you for me.
01:39:24:00&01:39:25:50#Um... Kim!
01:39:25:58&01:39:28:08#We are Sex Bob-Omb and
we are here to watch
01:39:28:17&01:39:30:58#Scott Pilgrim kick your teeth in!
01:39:30:67&01:39:31:79#One! Two!
Three! Four!
01:39:52:82&01:39:54:40#How's it going back there?
01:39:55:69&01:39:57:86#You dick!
01:39:58:82&01:40:00:16#Knives?
01:40:00:24&01:40:01:78#I know you're in here.
Don't attack...
01:40:01:87&01:40:03:58#Scott!
01:40:05:79&01:40:07:54#Steal my boyfriend!
01:40:07:62&01:40:08:91#Taste my steel!
01:40:09:96&01:40:10:96#Enough!
01:40:11:04&01:40:12:17#No, Scott.
01:40:12:54&01:40:15:13#This fat-ass hurt me and
I will have my revenge!
01:40:15:21&01:40:19:05#No, Knives, I hurt you.
I cheated on you.
01:40:20:72&01:40:22:72#I cheated on both of you.
01:40:24:72&01:40:26:47#I'm really sorry.
01:40:27:06&01:40:28:56#And you're not a fat-ass.
01:40:29:14&01:40:31:02#She didn't mean that.
01:40:33:40&01:40:34:77#So, are we all good?
01:40:38:03&01:40:39:49#Never felt better.
01:40:39:57&01:40:40:99#Yoo-hoo!
01:40:42:07&01:40:44:62#Are we done with the
hugging and learning?
01:40:45:91&01:40:47:95#I thought we had a fight going on here!
01:40:48:20&01:40:49:58#You've got a fight,
all right!
01:40:51:37&01:40:52:42#Wrong move, baby.
01:41:08:81&01:41:09:93#Hey.
01:41:24:32&01:41:27:33#You made me swallow my gum.
01:41:29:58&01:41:32:62#It's gonna be in my digestive
tract for seven years.
01:42:16:50&01:42:19:04#Yeah, still my girl.
01:42:22:30&01:42:23:51#Let's both be girls.
01:42:28:72&01:42:30:97#Bad! Bad!
01:42:43:15&01:42:44:11#What?
01:42:44:20&01:42:45:36#Get ready!
01:42:46:24&01:42:47:53#Here we go!
01:42:56:71&01:42:59:04#Good! Good! Good!
01:42:59:50&01:43:00:75#Combo!
01:43:05:05&01:43:06:17#Perfect!
01:43:18:77&01:43:21:90#Who do you think you are, Pilgrim?
01:43:21:98&01:43:24:40#You think you're better than me?
01:43:25:36&01:43:27:61#I'll tell you what you are.
01:43:27:70&01:43:29:70#A pain in my ass!
01:43:30:37&01:43:34:08#You know how long it took
01:43:34:29&01:43:36:87#to get all the evil exes'
contact information
01:43:36:96&01:43:39:54#so I could form this stupid league?
01:43:39:63&01:43:43:21#Like, two hours!
Two hours!
01:43:45:80&01:43:47:92#You're not cool enough for Ramona.
01:43:48:30&01:43:50:59#You're zero!
You're nothing!
01:43:50:97&01:43:53:10#Me? I'm what's hip.
01:43:53:18&01:43:54:60#I'm what's happening!
01:43:54:68&01:43:56:60#I'm blowing up right now!
01:43:57:18&01:43:58:64#You are blowing up.
01:43:59:35&01:44:00:60#Right now!
01:44:01:94&01:44:04:44#K-O!
01:44:13:49&01:44:16:58#Wow!
01:44:18:71&01:44:23:46#Yeah, wow.
01:44:29:88&01:44:31:38#There goes our deal!
01:44:31:47&01:44:33:60#We're still getting paid, right?
01:44:33:68&01:44:36:06#There goes our deal.
01:44:36:27&01:44:38:68#Oh! Oh, God!
01:44:49:49&01:44:50:90#You two make a good combo.
01:44:51:91&01:44:53:07#Yeah?
01:44:54:03&01:44:55:08#Yeah.
01:44:55:16&01:44:58:33#Scott Pilgrim.
01:45:01:42&01:45:04:21#You can defeat me, Scott,
01:45:04:67&01:45:08:21#but can you defeat yourself?
01:45:15:68&01:45:16:85#Nega Scott.
01:45:16:97&01:45:18:52#Nega Scott!
01:45:22:56&01:45:23:81#No.
01:45:24:02&01:45:25:94#This is something I have to face.
01:45:29:19&01:45:30:32#Myself.
01:45:32:45&01:45:34:70#Solo round!
01:45:36:12&01:45:39:62#They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it
01:45:39:70&01:45:40:91#and you get bacon on the side.
01:45:41:00&01:45:42:12#I'm liking that.
01:45:42:21&01:45:43:87#Let's do it next week.
Yeah, Tuesday.
01:45:43:96&01:45:45:08#Yeah, all right.
Be good.
01:45:45:17&01:45:46:25#Yeah, yeah.
01:45:46:59&01:45:47:63#Hey.
01:45:49:05&01:45:50:46#What happened?
01:45:50:55&01:45:53:47#Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.
01:45:53:55&01:45:55:26#We're gonna get brunch next week.
01:45:55:39&01:45:57:14#We actually have a lot in common.
01:45:57:22&01:46:00:22#Your hair,
it's getting really shaggy.
01:46:00:81&01:46:02:52#It is?
Yeah.
01:46:03:94&01:46:06:23#You should probably get it cut.
01:46:07:06&01:46:08:52#Yeah, you're right.
01:46:08:77&01:46:09:98#I should get it cut.
01:46:10:07&01:46:11:57#At a salon.
01:46:11:65&01:46:13:99#Salon, yeah.
That sounds really nice.
01:46:14:07&01:46:15:49#Hey.
01:46:16:78&01:46:18:03#You're going?
01:46:18:58&01:46:20:54#I should probably disappear.
01:46:20:95&01:46:22:33#After all that?
01:46:23:08&01:46:25:08#I still need a new life.
01:46:25:92&01:46:29:42#I came here to escape,
but the past keeps catching up.
01:46:30:38&01:46:32:51#I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.
01:46:32:59&01:46:34:92#I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it.
01:46:35:59&01:46:37:59#I don't mean just you.
01:46:40:43&01:46:42:14#I understand.
01:46:43:98&01:46:45:73#I should thank you, though.
01:46:45:81&01:46:47:23#For what?
01:46:49:36&01:46:52:32#For being the nicest guy I ever dated.
01:46:54:32&01:46:56:11#That's kind of sad.
01:46:58:66&01:47:00:45#It is kind of sad.
01:47:03:79&01:47:05:29#Bye, and stuff.
01:47:06:50&01:47:09:92#Yeah. And stuff.
01:47:15:30&01:47:17:22#Go, get her.
01:47:18:14&01:47:19:59#What?
01:47:19:68&01:47:22:43#You've been fighting for her all along.
01:47:24:73&01:47:26:14#But what about you?
01:47:26:98&01:47:28:77#I'll be fine.
01:47:32:90&01:47:35:44#I'm too cool for you anyway.
01:47:39:91&01:47:41:16#Ciao, Knives.
01:47:41:91&01:47:43:08#Go.
01:47:48:71&01:47:49:96#Hey.
01:47:50:04&01:47:52:42#Hey, mind if I tag along?
01:47:55:01&01:47:56:46#You want to come with me?
01:47:56:84&01:48:00:97#Yeah, I thought maybe
we could try again.
01:48:24:62&01:48:29:71#Continue?
Nine, eight, seven, six,
01:48:29:79&01:48:34:25#five, four, three, two, one.
01:48:35:00&01:48:38:08#
